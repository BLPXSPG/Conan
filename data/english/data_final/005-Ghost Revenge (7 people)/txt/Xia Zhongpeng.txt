Character background
You have always remembered "brothers, friends, and brothers" all your life, but you didn't expect that this would make you the "murderer" who killed them.
You were born in the twelfth year of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty (1873), and you are one of the heirs of "Xia Family Boxing". When your father [Xia Beigui] was alive, the Xia Family's 16-style "Tongxing Iron Fist" was famous in the south of the Yangtze River, and captured "Ren's Four Elephants Palm" is called "Southern Fist and North Palm" in the martial arts world. In the 21st year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu (1895), you went to Yunjian to compete, defeated several foreign martial arts masters who set up competitions, and received a "golden medal" engraved with "Hero of Jinmen" from the imperial court.
These beautiful scenery cannot replace the disappointment that the elder brother "Moyun Shenquan" [Xia Bolong] suffered after returning from the martial arts competition. When he inherited the boxing gym, the country was being humiliated. You had no martial arts skills, but you could only gain dignity in the ring. Outside the ring, you still endured humiliation and eked out a living. The eldest brother often went to Buji's "Shui Xuan Restaurant" to get drunk, and met Yu Jin, the owner of the restaurant. The two fell in love despite the fact that he already had a family.
You dote on your third brother [Xia Sanhu] very much. In the Year of 1898 (1898), you persuaded your eldest brother to send him to study abroad, and he chose to study in Qi, where the "reform" began thirty years ago.
[Xia Sanhu] suddenly returned to China in the Gengzi Year (1900), and with him came a well-dressed young man who called himself [Tian Jixiu Yi]. He said in Chinese that he was affiliated with "Tagoshi Co., Ltd." of Sennippon Kanto,
[Xia Sanhu] owed them a gambling debt and gave them his life. Now the "Xia Family Boxing Gym" has to work for the "Co., Ltd." in the next few years to repay the debt, otherwise [Xia Sanhu] will have to pay with his life.
The third brother kept kowtowing and shouted to the eldest brother and the second brother to save me, but the eldest brother was still hesitant. [Tian Jixiu Yi] proposed to decide in the way of a martial artist: three months later, he comes to the boxing gym to challenge "Xiajia Boxing". If he loses, the debt will be written off; if he wins, the entire "Xiajia Boxing Gym" It's theirs. The eldest brother agreed.
Later, [Xia Sanhu] actually took advantage of the fact that while his elder brother was away at his old house outside the city to concentrate on preparing for the fight, he used the boxing gym as a cover to help [Japanese] buy and sell things. If you can't persuade him, you can only ask the elder brother to come back. When the eldest brother meets, he must enforce the family law.
[Xia Sanhu] Please save him, just stop my brother. [Xia Bolong] Angrily went back to the house to drink alcohol and fell ill the next day. You invite the famous Chinese medicine doctor [Li Zicai] from Buji's "Jiashan Tang" Medical Center to prescribe medicine for him.
One night, [Xia Sanhu] was boiling medicine for her elder brother. His seven-year-old daughter [A'e] (Xia Shue) was also there. She shouted that her father should get well quickly. After the medicine was ready, [A'e] took the medicine. To give her father a drink. Not long after the elder brother drank it, he fell into convulsions and fell from the bed to the ground. [Xia Sanhu] went to help him, but he grabbed his throat and asked sternly: Is it you who poisoned me? [Xia Sanhu] couldn't move, so he could only squeeze out a voice from his throat: Second brother, save me... You couldn't break away the elder brother's hand in the past, so in desperation, you used the skill of seizing a mortar blade and punched the elder brother.
[Xia Bolong] suddenly let go and fell down. His mouth and nose were bleeding, and his protruding eyes were not closed until he died.
[Xia Sanhu] panted and said: Second brother, good fight, the eldest brother is too stubborn... That [Japanese] is not something you can afford to offend. If we win against him, no one in the Xia family will survive. We will lose. , the boxing gym must be given to them. In this competition, winning or losing is a dead end... Now that I am helping [Tian Ji], he promised to cancel the bet... Now that you have lost your mind, just listen to your third brother's arrangement, move the body to the bed, and lie to the outside world The eldest brother passed away due to illness.
A month later, you competed on behalf of the boxing gym, and the gambling game turned into a normal competition. Because of your elder brother's incident, you couldn't even perform 50% of your usual skills during the competition. After you fell to the ground, you were chased by [Tian Jixiu Yi] with a knee and injured your lower back. When you hear the doctor say that you may never stand up again, you feel relieved. You feel that this is the fate you deserve.
From then on, you sat in a wheelchair and [Xia Sanhu] became the leader (he swore to you that he would never go out to gamble again). Years later, [Tian Jixiu Yi] has not appeared again, and everything seems to have returned to normal.
Not long after the eldest brother passed away, the eldest sister-in-law also left, leaving only her daughter [A'e]. Her martial arts was taught by you. She practices very hard and is very sensible. From the age of sixteen, she has been doing almost all the teaching work in the boxing gym. [A'e] respects you like a father and always takes care of you. For more than ten years, thanks to her helping you to do lower limb activities, the muscles have not atrophied. In order to help you regain your standing, she has participated in "nurse" training in many hospitals and tried everywhere for you to find "rehabilitation" methods.
In fact, your injuries have already healed. What makes you unable to stand is the deep guilt in your heart.

Recent events (July to August 2)
(July 19) A [man with a Western-style beard] came to the boxing gym, saying in Chinese that he was the "specialist" of "Tianji Co., Ltd." and came to see an "old acquaintance" [Xia Sanhu]. You wouldn't have thought that this "Co., Ltd." would appear again like a ghost! When you took his business card, your hands couldn't help but tremble. The business card reads: Qiezhumeng Leitianji Co., Ltd. Yushe Yuzuganxi (Shangzhu stone color) Yiji.
You said [Xia Sanhu] was not here and asked him to leave a message. He said he came to visit his "old friend" and discuss some "things from the past" in person. Since he was not here, he would come back in two days. You asked him to leave his address, and he said that if you want to contact him, just go to "Francey's Cake Shop" in Qiejin. After he left, you gave your business card to [Xia Sanhu]. He kept reading the name, and then said: "It's him, I didn't expect him to come to collect debts..." You advised him to go out and hide for a while, and he gritted his teeth and said: "No need to hide." , old debts always have to be paid...
(July 21st) [Yu Zu Chengmu] came, [Xia Sanhu] took him to Mihuang. At the end of the corridor in front of the guest room in [Inner House], there is a "revolving wooden door" with paintings hanging on the outside to cover it up. After they came out, [Xia Sanhu] sent [Yu Zu Chengmu] out excitedly.
(July 28) [Xia Shue] is not in the boxing gym, but [Xia Sanhu] is in the indoor martial arts gym demonstrating grappling with you. You easily grabbed him while sitting in a wheelchair, and his collar was torn when he broke away. You asked him privately why he was so powerless? He said that he once had a fight with a "Feng's Descendant" and was injured by the other party's hidden force. The old injury recurred in the past few days at the end of the month, and he couldn't use any strength, and even ordinary people couldn't fight. You need to ask the doctor, and he will say that he has prescribed "Chinese medicine" for the disease, and he has been taking it for the past few days.
(July 29) [Xia Sanhu] sent home a disciple who was knocked unconscious while practicing martial arts. He came back very late. He told you that he had something to do with "Yue", and "Yue" actually dared to be calm. Remembering "Xia Family Boxing Gym" will make him walk around without food sooner or later.
(July 30) "Zhabei Western Hospital" informed that [Xia Shue] was hospitalized. When you told [Xia Sanhu] (in a low voice), he was very nervous and gave everything in his hand to the disciple [Aming] in the boxing gym (his name is Luo Ming, who works at the dock), and kept telling him things. You couldn't wait any longer, so you went to the hospital first and saw [A'e] sleeping soundly in the hospital bed. The nurse said that she needed to rest and that there was nothing serious, so you felt relieved. You know that [A'e] has been working hard for the management of the boxing gym and your "rehabilitation", shouldering too many burdens that are not hers. The fatigue and pressure have accumulated for a long time, and even an iron man can't help it. When you came back, [Xia Sanhu] was storing many doors, windows and furniture into the [inner house]. You saw him pick up a piece of "yellow paper" from the [inner house] door and put it in his arms.

Today (August 3rd)
[Xia Sanhu] Then [A'e], who was still sleeping, went home to rest. You said that [A'e] should find a local man to be her husband. [Xia Sanhu] said that it would be better to choose one of the apprentices. He felt that [A'e] pretty good.
You stayed with her in [A'e]'s room and were very happy to see her awake. You tell her that she falls ill and is hospitalized because she is usually too tired. She must take care of herself in the future. Uncle Yi and Er are old, so it doesn't matter what happens. After you finish saying this, go to [Outer Courtyard] Xuan Lan to get her ginseng porridge.
You see, after [A'e] finished drinking the porridge, some color returned to her face. Let her stay in bed and have a good rest. We can wait until she takes good care of other things.

In the Xia family boxing gym

In addition to looking at the watch or clock, game men can also tell the time by imitating it, and there will be about 5-10 minutes of movement.
(06:50) [Xia Sanhu] moved a "wooden door" from the [inner house] to the outside of the standing house and placed it against the wall. He said that he wanted to open a door here and change the standing door into an "office". It was originally placed here It was passed down from our ancestors that Dongyou [Xia Sanhu] wanted to change the way the boxing gym was run, so he vacated the place. You liked the old way of running the gym, but you still supported his decision. You advised him to be careful with his strength, but he said his injury was healed.
(17:00) A [rich businessman-looking man] came in and [Xia Sanhu] introduced him as [Yue Dongwen], the big boss of "Shanghai Yue's Medicinal Materials Company". You guys exchanged a few words.
(17:10) [Xia Sanhu] takes [Yue Dongwen] to the [inner house] to be destroyed, and you come out to the [outer courtyard].
(17:20) You saw [Yu Zu Chengmu] asking [Aming] about [Xia Sanhu]'s room and then walking into the [inner house]. After that, you go to the indoor martial arts training hall and ask your disciples (Lu Dong, Abao, etc.) to go to the cafeteria together.
(17:40) You brought your disciples to Yizhi and saw [Aming] tied to a chair. When you asked [Lu Dong] to untie him, [Aming] shouted: Uncle Master! The boss (Xia Sanhu) was crazy. I saw him putting things in the guests’ tea, so he knocked him down and tied him to a chair... You told [Aming] not to talk nonsense, but you were worried that what he said was true. You go back to [Inner House] immediately to find [Xia Sanhu].
(17:50) You saw [Yue Dongwen] slumped on a chair at the abandoned door of the [inner house], with his fingertips twitching and a painful expression. There was a broken teacup on the ground. You didn’t expect that your third brother would commit this crime under your eyes. It was a mistake, and the guilt made you angry for the first time at what he had done.
(18:00) You come to "Xia Sanhu's room" and see him rummaging through things. You ask him how long he will make a mistake? He ignored you, pulled out a sharp "dagger" and was about to go out. You grab his "black belt" and ask him who he wants to kill this time? He squeezed out a name [Luo Ming] through his teeth. You didn't expect that he would not even let go of the disciples who saw him poisoning. Seeing that you didn't let go, he kicked your wheelchair away. You fell to the ground and still didn't let go of your hand. You almost begged and said: Third brother, you can't make the same mistake again and again... [A'e] We have suffered so much in these years, it is all the sins we made...

[Xia Sanhu] sneered: Second brother, stop pretending to be a good person! Then he cut his belt with a knife, turned around to open the door, and then turned back and said: [A'e] has already turned his arm outwards, and he won't care about you as a cripple anymore. As soon as I finish taking care of Luo, I will settle the score with her.

When you heard this, you could no longer hold back your anger. This force made you stand up. You used the "black belt" to strangle [Xia Sanhu]'s neck from behind. He kept struggling and the "dagger" in his hand fell. to the ground. You didn't let go. He stretched his hands into the air, trying to use his last strength to grab something. The last voice you heard him was "Second brother, save me..." Then [Xia Sanhu] widened his eyes and stopped. Take a breath.
(18:10) You said to [Xia Sanhu]’s corpse: Third brother, I’m sorry, I’ve always spoiled you too much, and that’s why I hurt you. Second brother will come to accompany you right now... You put on the “black crimson belt” He crossed the rafters and wanted to die. At this time, you think of [A'e], if you all leave, all the burden of the Xia family will fall on the shoulders of a girl like her. She has lost her happy childhood and cannot even have a future! You have to at least see her find someone reliable before she can feel at ease. You put down the idea of ​​seeking death, moved [Xia Sanhu]'s body to the bed, and dropped out of his arms a "Xia Shue's personal letter" addressed to him:
"I'm going to investigate the cause of my father's death and leave the boxing gym for a while. Please don't worry about me. I have friends outside who will take care of me. Please tell my uncle not to forget to do rehabilitation exercises. Xia Shue"
You don't know who [A'e]'s "friends" outside are, so you keep the letter in your arms.
(18:20) You sit in the wheelchair and go back to your room. You see [Yu Zu Chengmu] and a [young man in a long gown] in your room. [Yu Zu Chengmu] bows his head to you and salutes, then goes out with his hands on his abdomen. [The young man in the long gown] also wants to go out. You grab him and ask him who he is and why he is here. He said his name was [Duan Yuetong], he was a policeman, and he came here to meet [Xia Guanzhu]. You let go of your hand and he shouted "Mr. Yuzu" and ran out.
(18:30) You wonder why they are in your house. When you go out and take a look, you suddenly realize that they regard your room as the "Xia Sanhu Room" (Xia Sanhu puts the wooden door outside the empty house, making your room from After entering the house, the second door on the right turns into the third door - they mistakenly thought it was the door of "Xia Sanhu House").
(18:40) You decide to make the mistake and move the "temporarily added door" before no one notices. Unexpectedly, your legs lost strength at this time, and the wooden door fell to the ground with a "loud bang". You quickly untied the "rope" (used when you exercise your upper body strength) from the wheelchair, tied it to the door, and pulled the craftsman in. Feili. You then find that [Yue Dongwen] is missing from the box! You crawled towards the wheelchair and just put your hands on it when a man ran over from the walking seat and knocked the wheelchair over. You fell face down to the ground and something fell out of your arms.
(18:50) When you climbed out of the wheelchair, you saw [Yu Zu Chengmu] walking into Chahu, and there was an extra "women's bag" on the wheelchair. At this time, [A'e], who was supposed to be recuperating in the house, came from the door of the [inner house]. She held up the wheelchair and helped you sit on it. You saw that there was sweat on her head, so you told her to stop running around after recovering from a serious illness. , go back to the house and rest immediately. She insists on sending you back to your room first. You ask her for the "women's bag" and she says it's not hers.
(19:00) After you returned home and calmed down, you realized that the "golden medal" in the cabinet was missing. You looked everywhere and only found a golden "tie clip" under the bed.
(19:10) [Aming] came to you and said that he wanted to see the leader, but he did not dare to see him alone. Please take him there. You take him into "Xia Sanhu's room" and are surprised to see [Xia Shue] lying on [Xia Sanhu]'s body. You went over to pick up [A'e] and felt relieved when you saw that she just fainted. You turn around and warn [Aming]: The leader has passed away. I will send [A'e] back to the house. You go call the police. Remember, you must not say you saw [A'e] here, otherwise I will destroy you. !
After [Aming] nodded and left, you picked up a "small paper bag" with "Insect Killer" written on the ground. It was already empty. You were afraid that [A'e] had dropped it, so you stuffed it into the "Women's List" "package". Then you throw the "tie clip" under the bed - you want to protect [A'e] and the gym, and make other people the scapegoats.
(19:20) You took [A'e] back to the house and came to the [outer courtyard]. You saw that [Duan Yuetong] was still there. He asked you where the "women's handbag" came from. You said you picked it up. , he says it belongs to his girlfriend, just give it back to him
(You feel that there is a lot in this bag and it is not light). He said goodbye to you, and you told [Aming] to call the police, so you didn’t say anything to him. Then he told his disciples not to enter [the inner chamber].
(19:50) You return to [A'e]'s room. When [A'e] wakes up, she says she was "attacked" and knocked unconscious. Before you have time to think about it, you quickly tell her that her third brother has passed away and ask her not to He said he had been to "Xia Sanhu Room".
(20:00) The police came to the boxing gym to investigate. Please go to Zhabei Police Station with [A'e] to help solve the case. You saw [Yue Dongwen] who was thought to have been poisoned to death at the police station, still alive talking to the police, and then you realized that you had made an unforgivable mistake. Behind these things, there was probably a terrible conspiracy...
