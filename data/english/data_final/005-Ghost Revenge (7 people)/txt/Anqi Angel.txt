Background
Your real name is Lan Qin. He was born in the 21st year of Guangxu (1895) in Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty. You live in Pudong. You and your brother A'an are alone by mother Yi Clan (Yi Lianzhi). Fortunately, my father has left a lot of money.Life is not difficult.
You don't have much impression of your father. The mother gives you a "decoration" (carved buttons) that he stays. You have to hold it every day to sleep when you were a kid.Later, the "decoration" was worn, and the mother gave you a "Jinxiang" embroidered with the word "He Jun".Before you.
Last year (1913), you were snatched "burdens" by a mixed in Pudong.You are desperately chasing outside the warehouse before stopping him.You didn't expect that he had a companion here, and they surrounded you all at once.
A short -haired youth came out of the warehouse and asked you to leave quickly. You told them that there is the "last thing" left by your father's father in the bag. You have to take it back anyway.The confused people laughed, and said to the short -haired youth, "Surname Li", you have less idleness, and then keep insulting you and him in words.
Short -haired young people knocked down the leading mixing, like a tiger who rushed into the wolf group, and fighting alone with them.You have never seen such a scene, there are no rules, only the blood that is splattered, accompanied by roar and screams, and only short -haired youths still stand firmly.You don't know how much his blood on his body is himself, and how many of them have been poured.
The "surname of Li" returned the "baggage" to you, warned you not to come to the pier again. He said: This place is not what kind of young lady like you should come ... you shake your head hard, and your words are stuck in your throat,Unable to speak.At this time, someone rushed over, a white hair Aber gave him medicine to stop bleeding, and several colleagues raised him and left before the police arrived.
When you came back, I found that even the name of [Big Brother Li] didn't know.You didn't dare to tell this matter [atong] or family, afraid they were worried.After this, you decide not to be a delicate girl.Because you are interested in new things in the Western in the West, you have nicknamed [Anqi] (ANGEL), and go to the concession's "Herlanis West Cake Shop" internship to make money.In addition to working, you have joined the progressive community "New Shanghai Girls Competition" for promoting "men's and women's rights".
The chief of the community [Luo Yisi] also nickname, she is one year younger than you, is from Zezhou government, and is rich in the family. He is a student of "John John from Shanghai St. John".Eat for a party, and sometimes go to the leaflet.
A boy with a nickname [ATong] (DUAN YUETONG), the same age as you, his mother [Auntie Duan] and your mother are "handkerchiefs". You grow up together. He is now a police officer.Boyfriend with plums and bamboo horses.He listens to you very much, but you think he is not mature enough.For example, he heard that your nickname is [anqi], and he claims to be "York", and he doesn't know what this English means.

What happened recently (July -August 2nd)
(July 19) You encounter a [suit man] with a "Western Beard" on the street. He uses Chinese to ask you in the "Xiajia Boxing Museum" in Zhabei.On the way you take him, you know that his surname is "Yu Zu", which is the "specialist" of Japan's "Tianji Hohara". He often comes to China to do business.You sent him to your destination. When he said goodbye, he held your hand and kissed your hand. You know that this is a foreign etiquette, so he did not refuse.He asked you if you can still meet, and you tell him the address of the "Franvisi Cake Shop".
(July 21) [Mr. Yu Zu] Come to the store to order a cup of coffee, and he took you to talk about it all afternoon.In the next few days, [Mr. Yu Zu] will come to the store to order a cup of coffee, tell you some foreign insights, and you also learn a few words of Japanese with him.For example, "Ali Gado, hit a hemp and four" is "Thank you, thank you very much", "One Lathaxi Mason" is "welcome to", "neon" is "Japan", and so on.
(July 25) You see [Mr. Yu Zu] with anxiety and ask him what happened. He said that after he lost his wife, he had no relatives in Japan and wanted to settle in Japan and marry his wife.When he speaks, his eyes are always looking at you.Then he sighed that he was too old, and no woman would see him ... You really can't stand a mother -in -law like a man like a mother, and persuaded him to say: No!He suddenly kissed your hand again, you blushed for a while, trying to hit this [Japanese guy], but still held back.When you calm down, he had left. When he left, he didn't pay coffee money. You padded it for him. When he thought about seeing him next time, he must give him good -looking!
After you go home, meet a [White Woman] and come to your mother. They talked about something in the house. After listening, your mother was very painful and asked your brother to send her away.You are about to comfort your mother.
He said that the "that person" of [Atong's mother] was looking for him, and he wanted two hundred or two silver, otherwise he would say everything that year. It doesn't matter if he "enters", he is afraid that [atong] will not be able to stand it.He couldn't get money now, and could only borrow it with "wife's good sisters". He returned within a week and could also give Sanli interest.Your mother asked [Uncle Bai] to write down the IOU and took out two two hundred and two silver tickets to him.After he left, your mother went to see [Auntie Duan] and talked to her about each other's troubles.
(July 26) [Mr. Yu Zu] and a [short -haired youth] come to the store together, you recognize that [short -haired youth] is the [Big Brother Li] at the pier last year.He helped [Mr. Yu Zu] sit down, and you noticed that [Mr. Yu Zu] was injured on his face. When you brought him a towel, [Big Brother Li] had left.
[Mr. Yu Zu] He said that he was beaten by the owner of the "Xiajia Boxing Museum" [xia Sanhu].[XIA SANHU] When Wang studied abroad, he owed him a lot of money. He and his friends (that is, [Big Brother li]) were available at the pier and needed money.He went to debt, [xia Sanhu] asked him to marry the daughter of the death brother [XIA Bolong], xia Sanhu's niece, otherwise he would not pay back.He disagreed and was beaten after the language conflict.
You know that [Mr. Yu Zu] and [Big Brother Li] are friends, and do business together, you will not mention coffee money.You ask how much he needs, he said with a smile, he said that he wanted to be two hundred or two silver, and he could pay you five points of interest.You promised to help him find a way to go home after asking for a way, and find that he couldn't speak with your mother. Your brother did not get off work at this time and could not find someone to discuss.
At this time, [atong] I took two hundred or two silver tickets to return your mother, you asked him to come over without telling your mother.You take the silver ticket to the store to [Mr. Yu Zu], and he solemnly writes you a "debit".
(August 2) [Mr. Yu Zu] and [Big Brother Li] came to the store together, and also give you a "two hundred two silver tickets", and "20 silver" interest, you are very happy, not because of making money, not because of making moneyInstead, I can finally have a little owner of [Big Brother Li] — but [Big Brother Li] I did not recognize you — you hear him to let [Mr. Yu Zu] go to the boxing hall tomorrow.

Today (August 3)
You attended the club party and helped your brother some things. He went home in the evening. As soon as you entered the door, he found that his mother looked wrong.
She asked you still remember the [White Woman] from that day?Her name is [XIA Shue], and is the "niece" of the "Xiajia Boxing Museum" museum in Zhabei.You think she wants to "marry" to [Mr. Yu Zu], and can't help but raise his lips.
[Yi CLAN] Continue to say that [atong ]'s mother was deceived by [Surname Xia] ... She was as young as you at that time, you don't know, there are too many bad people in Shanghai ... [The surname Xia] went to her to go to herThe house restaurant was drinking and said that she didn't bring money. She was kind to him for a while. As a result, the man borrowed the opportunity of repaying money to lie to her ... The [fiance] of her engagement also retired, and the current husband [bai Changgong] is not[Atong] Biological father ... Mother said, walking to the place where the silver ticket was put.You are guilty.
You see her open the box, take out a stack of silver tickets to ask you, do you know how these money came from?You said it was left by his father.[Yi CLAN] nodded and said: Your father was for these money ... doing things for people, he knew the wrong person ... I did something wrong ... At this point, her voice became swallowed, you're afraid she will nextI have to ask you to hide her money to lend to [Mr. Yu Zu], and casually says that go to Zhabei to find your brother back, and then run out.
You actually don't know where your brother is at this time. You think of [atong] and don't want to find him.In fact, you want to see [Big Brother Li] now. You know that he is about [Mr. Yu Zu] to go to the boxing hall, but you need a reason to convince yourself.
You thought hard for a long time, and finally thought of [XIA Shue], how can [xia Sanhu] forced [Mr. Yu Zu] to marry her, you decided to find her clearly, if it was indeed her uncle forced her, you can ask you the community head to the head of the communityHe appeared with friends -now is the Republic of China. You should "equal rights and women", and you cannot marry someone according to the requirements of the elders.
So you went to the "Xiajia Boxing Hall" in Zhabei.
In the Xiajia Boxing Hall
(18:10) You arrive at the "Xiajia Boxing Hall" and ask the disciples in the courtyard to inquire about the position of [xia shue].He tells you that "Master Xia" turns left in the corridor in the [House] corridor, the innermost room.When you enter the [inner house], see the back of a [wealthy businessman], he turns left at the first turning point of the corridor.You have always turned to the left.
(18:20) You knocked on the door at the door of the "XIA Shue Room", but no one agreed.You pushed the door in and didn't see people, so he waited in the room.
(18:30) The voice of [Duan Yuetong] came from the room, and he shouted, "Mr. Yu Zu!" You don't know that they actually know you, don't want to be seen by [atong], worrying about him told his mother, or misunderstanding.
(18:40) You decided to avoid [Atong] home.At this time, "a loud noise" came from the distant [inner house], as if it was the sound of heavy things hitting the ground.You came out of the "XIA Shue Room", carefully walked to the door of the [inner house], and saw [Duan Yuetong] talking to people outside. Fortunately, he didn't see you.You hurried to the corridor on the left, because of panic, he didn't pay attention to the wheelchair at the door of the right hand side, and hit it and fell together.When you get up, you can see that there is a [middle -aged man] lying on the ground in the seat, and it looks like falling off the wheelchair.(18:50) You ran to the end of the corridor on the left, and saw a hanging picture hanging to the ground, and planned to hide behind.You lifted the painting and found a "rotating wooden door", and pushed the door in.In the back is an unmanned blue place. You turn around and look out, and find a XIA Shue lifted the wheelchair, help [middle -aged man] sit on the wheelchair, and then push him to [inner house]inside.
(19:00) You see [Mr. Yu Zu] come out of the house on the right side of the dense outdoor. At this time, you find that the "women's cover bag" you carry with you is gone -inside not only "two hundred two silver tickets" and"Twenty silver", as well as the "carving button" left by his father.
You quickly found it on the blue road and found no.You came out of the secret room anxiously, at the corridor turning, and felt a little wrong. At this time, you glanced into the third door on the right side of the corridor.You immediately followed him and wanted to talk to her privately about marrying [Mr. Yu Zu].
You pushed the door and saw [XIA Shue] lying on the bed in the room, and her hand was placed around the man's neck.Your face becomes hot immediately, and even if you don't dare to go in, you turn around and run out, as if you have done something that he can't see.
(19:10) You see [Duan Yuetong] standing at the south gate of [outer courtyard], and walk from the trail behind the dormitory and indoor training to the east gate, and then leave.
(19:30) You were stopped by [duan yuetong] on the way home. He smiled and returned your "female mask" to you with a smile. You can quickly open it.EssenceHe wants to send you home, you think of you running out, and say goodbye to him in advance.
(19:50) You see [Mr. Yu Zu] into a small hotel.You want to tell him about seeing [xia shue] and [man in white], and follow them.He had packed his luggage in a humble room.He saw you, and said with a bad face: My business failed, and I will go back tomorrow ... You can comfort his business failure, and if you are discouraged, you will be defeated.He asked you: I don't have a penny now. Are we still friends?You are afraid that this person will make a fool of suicide, and the friend of [Big Brother Li] is your friend, and you seriously answer him: Yes.
(20: 00) Several police officers came in and asked [Mr. Yu Zu] to go to Zhabei Police Station to assist in the investigation. He asked you if you could accompany him, you agreed.Then you see [Big Brother Li] and [Atong] in the police station, and you can't help worrying.
