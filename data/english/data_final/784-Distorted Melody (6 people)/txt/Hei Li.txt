story background
September 21, 1914 (the third year of the Republic of China)
After the outbreak of World War I, the imperial powers were busy on the European battlefield, but they still did not forget to split China and absorb China!
In the 34th year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty (1908), the entire "Shanghai-Nanjing Railway" was opened to traffic. Zhenjiang, which passed along the way, had been opened up as a concession by the British as early as 1861. In 1911, the Ministry of Industry Bureau of the British Concession occupied Jiangxi in front of the concession. Set up a fence along the road.
The terrain near Zhenjiang is high in the west and low in the east. There are many rivers. One of them is called the "White Bird River" because white migratory birds stay on it every year. There is a small Western-style building in the south of the "Baiwu River", which houses residents. A widowed Mrs. Ruan rents out the empty house of "Ruan House" all year round...····
your story
Your name is [Hei Li]. You are an orphan. You were born in the 19th year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty (1893). You were brought up by your adoptive father [Qi Qingli] - his adoptive father was a dancer who had studied abroad. Later, he was injured and stopped performing on stage. .
There is also an adopted son [Qi Gu Fei] (your adopted brother) beside your adoptive father, who is 3 years older than you. You and he grew up together, learning dancing and literacy together, and you are more of the same family than ordinary siblings. righteous.
When you were 10 years old (1902), your adoptive father was introduced by an old classmate who lived in the "British Concession" in Zhenjiang and got a job teaching dance. He took his step-brother and you to the "Ruan House" in the east of Zhenjiang to rent a house. You live in "Guest Room 5" on the first floor - your adoptive father chose this place because the hall on the first floor is spacious, making it easier for you to practice dancing.
The landlord [Mrs. Ruan] has two daughters [Zhaonan] [Wangdi] and a son [Guilang]. Among them, [Zhaonan] is 2 years older than you. She often comes to see her step-brother dance with you, and even learns from you - Adoptive father praises [Zhaonan] was very talented, but Mrs. Ruan didn't take it seriously. It wasn't until she heard from her adoptive father that the foreigners in the "British Concession" in Zhenjiang often held dance parties, and girls who danced well might be invited, that she agreed to [Zhaonan] learn it.
You liked [Zhaonan] very much as soon as you met. Not only did you teach her all your experience, but you also practiced with her every day. At that time, there was a [Luo Xiucai] living on the second floor of the "Ruan House". He was a young man who had never passed the entrance examination. With his fame and fame, he lives in a rented house with his son [Luo Younuo] and daughter [Xue Yan]. Apart from being invited by [Mrs. Ruan] to teach [Guilang] how to read, he has no other livelihood - [Luo Xiucai] always takes advantage of his adoptive father to go out. I watched you and [Zhaonan] practicing dance on the second floor. Your sworn brother hated him very much. You almost got into a fight with him once, but [Zhaonan] ran upstairs to stop you.
One year later (1903), [Zhaonan] has made great progress, and you are happy about it. Your adoptive father also likes [Zhaonan] more and more, and often praises her, which also makes you feel a little pressure... Later [Zhaonan] 】Come to you again for advice. You have nothing to teach her.
In early February of the lunar calendar, [Zhaonan] suddenly fell down and sprained her foot while dancing. You were very anxious, so you and your adopted brother sent her upstairs to her room (sister's room) - you know [Zhaonan], she is The kind of girl who hides everything in her heart - you think she has something on her mind, but you don't know how to ask her, so you can only leave [Zhaonan] to rest in the house, go downstairs to practice alone, and see [Luo Xiucai] appear again. 【Zhaonan】Outside the house······
Soon after, [Luo Xiucai] owed the rent and left without saying goodbye, leaving his son [Luo Younuo] and daughter [Xue Yan] in the "Ruan House". [Mrs. Ruan] adopted these two children without a father and mother, helping Working with her.


[Zhaonan] once had a dispute with her sister [Wangdi]. After that, [Zhaonan] became quiet and always stayed alone in her room on the second floor. She only went downstairs when practicing and focused all her energy on learning to dance. , except for her brother [Guilang], there seems to be nothing that she cares about more... You and [Zhaonan] have become competitive with each other, but you have never hated [Zhaonan], you just don't want to be surpassed by her.
A few years later (1908), [Luo Younuo] took [Xue Yan] to move out of the "Ruan House", and [Guilang] went to live in the city to study. With the opening of the "Shanghai-Nanjing Railway", my adoptive father had the idea of ​​starting a theater troupe in Shanghai... When you said goodbye to [Zhaonan], you saw her look of loss and realized that you couldn't bear to be separated from her, so you persuaded [Zhaonan] to say goodbye. Zhaonan】Go to Shanghai with you, perform on stage with you and your adopted brother, and become stars together!
[Zhaonan] nodded and said he was going to say goodbye to his brother. You looked at [Zhaonan]'s excited look and were glad that you said what you were thinking... Then you convinced your adoptive father to take [Zhaonan] to Zhenjiang, After she finishes meeting [Guilang], she will get on the train with you and come to Shanghai, which is known as the "Paris of the East".
The adoptive father established the "Traveler Theater" with the support of his old classmates. The adopted brother performed the official role, and you and [Zhaonan] worked as backup dancers to gain experience. Life in those days was very difficult, with constant training every day, but you watched When [Zhaonan] showed a long-lost smile... You and [Zhaonan] encouraged each other, held hands and made a promise: Even if only one person can go on stage in the end, it should be the same as when two people are together... ··
In the first year of the Republic of China (1912), men cut off their braids, and you and [Zhaonan] finally had the opportunity to appear on stage as leading actors for the first time.
My adoptive father slightly adapted "Swan Lake" by Russian composer "Tchaikovsky" and put it on the stage, letting [Zhaonan] and you play the roles of "White Swan" (Princess Odette) and "Black Swan" (The Devil) respectively. daughter, the adopted brother plays the "Prince" - you thought you would be the heroine, but you didn't expect your adoptive father to choose [Zhaonan] to play the role of "White Swan". After listening to the story her adoptive father told her about the role, she even picked up a stage name "White Bird"... Your adoptive father comforts you. Although the "White Swan" played by [Zhaonan] is the heroine of the story, the most eye-catching dance on the stage was completed by the "Black Swan" played by you. .
The adoptive father then chose a comedy ending between sad and happy endings: the "White Swan" and the "Prince" rely on true love to defeat the magic of the "Devil King" and lift the curse - in the story, the "Black Swan" once disguised himself as a princess, and the adoptive father will let you and [Zhaonan] put on the "Black Feather Mask" and "White Feather Mask" respectively.
You guess this is because you have been distracted during practice recently - it turns out that your adoptive father's old classmate passed away last year, leaving behind an only son [Wang Zimo] who inherited a large inheritance and a property in the "British Concession" in Zhenjiang. Because with the British When I work, I sometimes accompany my boss on business trips to Shanghai and visit the troupe's residence.
[Wang Zimo] I saw you practicing in the corridor that day, and ran over to say hello, saying that he likes dancing very much, especially "Swan Lake", and he also bought a Japanese adaptation of the novel... What do you think? The handsome [Wang Zimo] had a good impression. After getting to know each other, he told him his name.
After that [Wang Zimo] often came to the troupe's residence to ask you out. You went out with him without telling others, had dinner with him in a Western restaurant in the public concession, and gradually fell in love - [Wang Zimo] once when he was tipsy, he said he must Marry the most dazzling woman on the stage as your wife - you can't help but take this sentence as a preview of the proposal, feel nervous, and accidentally drop the fork... [Wang Zimo] bend down to pick it up, take the opportunity Take off one of your shoes and touch your delicate feet. You blushed and hurriedly took your feet out of his hands, picked up your shoes and put them on.
After that date, [Wang Zimo] returned to Zhenjiang... You couldn't help but feel depressed, but you also expected that he would rush back to Shanghai to celebrate you when you made your debut on stage.
In September, [Zhaonan] said she wanted to tell her family about her performance on stage, so she took leave to go back. Later, she took her sister [Wangdi] back to Shanghai and rented a cheap house near the troupe's residence to live with her sister.
On September 21st, "The Traveling Bird Theater" performed "Swan Lake" for the first time. You and [Zhaonan] danced very well - your performance was in the penultimate act. After dancing, you went backstage to take off your makeup and watched from the side of the stage. In the last scene, applause for your adopted brother and [Zhaonan] - at this time you see [Wang Zimo] holding flowers in the auditorium, you feel happy, and you don’t wait for the curtain to end, go back to your residence to dress up early, and wait for [Wang Zimo] Come and invite you out like I did before.
You waited until night, but [Wang Zimo] didn't show up. Later, your adopted brother came to you and advised you not to be sad because you didn't play "White Swan". There will be many opportunities in the future... During the performance the next day, you still I was in a bad mood and almost made a mistake. Unexpectedly, [Zhaonan]'s performance was not as good as the first day. You were both left behind by your adoptive father and severely criticized. You didn’t mention [Wang Zimo], and you didn’t dare to think about him again.
In November, the performance came to an end. 【Wang Zimo】Finally came to the troupe's residence to look for you. You ran out to see him, but he said he wanted to break up with you. You pretended to be calm and said with a smile that it was nothing... You can't remember how you managed to hold on. You didn’t cry in front of her, especially when you heard [Wang Zimo] say from his own mouth that he fell in love with [Zhaonan] and was going to marry her... You only cried after [Wang Zimo] left, feeling sour and bitter. , I wanted to go find [Zhaonan] to ask, but I didn’t see her. I heard that [Zhaonan] had sent her sister home...
Not long after, the adoptive father received a wedding invitation from [Wang Zimo] and a resignation letter he wrote for [Zhaonan] - [Zhaonan] quit the troupe and married [Wang Zimo] without telling you anything! You gritted your teeth and held back this breath, without letting anyone know your thoughts. You put all your energy on the stage and vowed to be the most dazzling star!
Your hard work pays off, your performances are getting better and better, and you can even play the "white swan" and "black swan" on the stage by yourself, no longer needing a mask, directly expressing two completely different temperaments! You asked your adoptive father to change the ending back to tragedy - the "Prince" confessed to the "Black Swan", allowing the devil's curse to take effect, and the "White Swan" died in pain after losing his lover... You gradually became famous and had many Suitors, but you just want to perform seriously and reject them one by one.
Last year (1913), [Zhaonan]’s younger brother [Guilang] also came to pursue you. You knew that [Zhaonan] loved this brother very much, so you wanted to take out his anger on him. You didn’t agree to [Guilang]’s pursuit, so Not saying no clearly and constantly accepting the flowers and gifts he sends you will torture this boy to the point of scratching his heart.
This year (1914), [Guilang] went shopping with you and saw a necklace inlaid with drop-shaped gemstones called "Swan Tears" in a British jewelry store. I liked it very much, but your income was only the salary of the theater troupe. After seeing the price tag of one hundred silver dollars, I could only shake my head helplessly.
[Guilang] said he wanted to buy it for you. You said he is still a student. Where can he have so much money? [Guilang] I will make a bet with you, saying that if he can give you this necklace, you will go home with him to meet his mother and confirm your relationship! You thought it was impossible, so you smiled and agreed to him.
In August, the troupe received an invitation to go to the "British Concession" in Zhenjiang and perform at a private reception on August 12. The other party also paid the remuneration in advance - it turned out that at this time, Britain entered the "World War", and there was a "Smith" "The Baron" planned to hold a reception at his home to raise funds for a charity sale for the British troops participating in the war.
On August 11, you and your adopted brother took the first-class train tickets bought by your adoptive father, took the "Shanghai-Nanjing Line" train (3809 times), and arrived in Zhenjiang after nearly 9 hours.


After getting off the bus, you and your step-brother saw that it was getting late, so you rented a room at the "Yuechang Hostel" outside the "British Concession". You and your step-brother rented a single room each.
In the morning of August 12th, your adopted brother and you brought your costumes and props to your employer's house in the concession. The reception was in the afternoon. After meeting the baron, your adopted brother and you walked around freely on the first floor of this mansion. , came to the corridor outside the kitchen, and saw [Guilang] talking to a girl. You thought the girl looked familiar. Your step-brother told you that she was the daughter of [Luo Xiucai] who used to live on the second floor of "Ruan House" [Xue Yan] 】.
Then you saw [Xue Yan]’s brother [Luo Younuo] and [Zhaonan]’s sister [Wangdi] (she didn’t look like Zhaonan, but she was also very beautiful) walking out of the kitchen together.
August 12, 10:00 (corridor outside the kitchen) greetings
You must do the following "performances" at this stage and you can also ask what you want to know
1. Because [Wang Zimo] is married, you are determined to conceal your past relationship with him.
2. You always tell others that when you perform "White Swan", you will think of [Zhaonan], who you have studied with since childhood, as if you are on stage for her, so you can perform two completely different temperaments.
3. You did not agree to be [Guilang]'s girlfriend, so you cannot let anyone know about your relationship with him or the bet you made with him - and you will not mention the necklace to him again.
4. You think [Xue Yan]’s temperament and behavior are not like ordinary maids. Ask her if she has ever learned to dance?
5. When you lived in "Ruan's House" before, [Guilang] was the youngest. Everyone regarded him as a younger brother and took care of him (after getting along with him, you felt that this "younger brother" also had something to like you) .
The story after the pleasantries
Your adopted brother took you away from the others and went to a room on the side of the corridor to start preparing for the afternoon performance.
Before the show starts, a waiter knocks on the door and says someone outside wants to see you. You followed the waiter out and saw that the person who wanted to see you was [Guilang] - [Guilang] looked solemn and took you to the corridor and said to you: "I will definitely get "Swan Tears", and so will you. Don't forget what you promised me..." You didn't expect that he would still remember this, so you just said that you were about to perform and couldn't be distracted now.
[Guilang] was about to say something when he saw [Wang Zimo] walking over - [Guilang] immediately turned around and hid, as if he was afraid of being seen by his "brother-in-law".
[Wang Zimo] didn't pay attention to [Guilang]. He walked up to you with "Swan Tears" and said that he hopes you can wear this necklace to perform - this is the meaning of the host of the reception, he wants to invite you to be a model.
You said that since it was work, you would listen to his arrangements, and then [Wang Zimo] put on the necklace for you behind your back, and suddenly said in your ear: "I really regret marrying Zhaonan..."
You immediately took a step forward and avoided him, but [Wang Zimo] still said to you: "You are my favorite... I regret it so much..." [Wang Zimo] 】With a pleading look, he tells you that his marriage is a failure, his wife only asks him for money, and his life is no fun...
You didn’t want to hear this, so you just said you still had a job. [Wang Zimo] stopped you and asked you where you live? You didn't answer, but avoided him, and at the same time told [Wang Zimo] to remember that he had a wife!
After saying this, you go back to find your adopted brother to prepare for the performance. Your adopted brother has already put on the British "formal sword" as a prop and pretends to be a "prince". You calm yourself down and quickly adjust to your condition.
In the afternoon, the performance started on time, and there were many invited guests in the hall. You and your step-brother did not pay attention to other people, and concentrated on presenting a wonderful "Swan Lake". In the last scene of the performance, although the "Prince" swore He wanted to save his lover from the devil, but because of his confession to the "black swan" disguised as a princess, the devil's curse took effect. The "white swan" died in pain after losing his lover... The audience applauded the performance , "Baron Smith" began to take out jewelry for auction, and the necklace you were wearing was also one of the auction items.
You knew that the price of this necklace was one hundred silver dollars, but unexpectedly [Wang Zimo] bought it for one hundred and fifty silver dollars. You smiled like a performer, took off the necklace and handed it to him. [Wang Zimo] took the necklace and whispered to you: "I bought it to give to the woman I love..." You continued to smile without any response.
Afterwards, your adopted brother and you went to the room on the side of the corridor to take off your makeup. When your adopted brother mentioned what happened just now, you asked your adopted brother: "Don't you know the man who bought the necklace? He used to come to the theater troupe's residence and it was the old classmate of his adoptive father. Son Wang Zimo." A look of surprise flashed across the sworn brother's face, and you realized that he didn't know [Wang Zimo] before.
You were afraid that [Wang Zimo] would pester you again, so you took your adopted brother to say goodbye in advance, took the costumes and props, left the Baron's house through the back door, returned to the hotel outside the concession, and went back to their rooms to rest, preparing to return to Shanghai the next day.
You originally wanted to visit [Zhaonan], but you gave up the idea after thinking about what [Wang Zimo] said to you... You have no resentment towards [Zhaonan], and you have always felt that she was forced to marry For [Wang Zimo] - As for what [Wang Zimo] said, you don't believe a single word - [Wang Zimo], whether getting married or looking for a lover, is just a temporary hothead, and it is not worthy of [Zhaonan] to marry him!
The next day (August 13), at 9:00 am, you and your adopted brother paid off the rent, took the "Shanghai-Nanjing Line" train (6154 trains) departing from Nanjing at 8:00, and returned to Shanghai.


After returning to the troupe, the adoptive father discovered that the wooden prop "Formal Sword" was not brought back. The step-brother said that he had forgotten it at the Baron's house. Only then did you remember that when you were taking off your makeup and packing up, you did not put the "Formal Sword" back. You were then In order to avoid [Wang Zimo], he urged his sworn brother to leave without carefully counting his things.
A month later (September 19), his adoptive father read the news of [Wang Zimo]'s death in the newspaper and wanted to go to Zhenjiang to express his condolences. However, he was unable to leave due to matters in the theater troupe, so his adoptive brother had to go on his behalf.
Yesterday (September 20), at 10:00 am, my adopted brother took the train to Zhenjiang. You were also shocked by the news of [Wang Zimo]'s death. Thinking that [Zhaonan] would be a widow from now on, you wanted to visit her.
In the evening, [Guilang], who has not been seen for a month, suddenly comes to you and brings you the "Swan Tears" that you bet with. You clearly remember that this necklace was bought by [Wang Zimo], so you quickly asked him who it was. Where did you get it? [Guilang] said that his mother gave it to him, and then immediately changed his story and said that his brother-in-law gave it to him. You took the necklace and felt that things were not simple, so you asked [Guilang] if he knew that his brother-in-law was dead?
[Guilang] hesitated for a moment and then said that he knew, and then stopped answering questions in this regard. He just kept urging you to fulfill your bet and go with him to see your mother. You asked [Zhaonan] how he is doing now? [Guilang] said that his eldest sister returned to "Ruan's house" from the concession. When you heard that [Zhaonan] was back home, you immediately agreed to go to "Ruan's House". [Guilang] also boasted that his sister would give him all his brother-in-law’s inheritance, reminding you that [Zhaonan] once told you that she always owed her brother, and that his brother lost his father because of her...
Then [Guilang] shamelessly asks you for a gift in return - you go back to the house and take out the "Black Feather Mask" you used to wear - since you starred in "Swan Lake" alone, you will never use this mask again, so simply Give it to [Guilang] and coax this cute "brother" to leave happily.
Today (September 21st), you got up early and told the people in the troupe that you were going to Zhenjiang. Then you put the necklace in your lady bag and rushed to the train station with the money.
At 8:00 am, you bought a cheap third-class ticket, took the train to Zhenjiang (6154 times), and arrived in Zhenjiang again after nearly 9 hours. After you get off the train, go to the "Yue Wang Hotel" outside the "British Concession" to rent a room. You see a discount notice posted in the hotel and there are many vacant rooms.
When the front desk was handling the deposit procedure for you, seeing that you were a female staying alone, they advised you not to go out at night. You ask why. The front desk hesitated and told you in a low voice: Last month, a "man named Wang" was killed in the alley behind the "Yue Wang Hotel" outside the concession, and all his belongings were robbed!
You quickly ask if the "person named Wang" is called [Wang Zimo]? The front desk said: Yes, that's the name. There is also a poster on the wall outside the concession looking for clues to the murderer of [Wang Zimo]... Your doubts became even greater. You put down your luggage in the hotel, only taking with you Take a lady's bag with you and head to "Ruan's House".
At about 20:00, you came to the door of "Ruan's House". When you pushed the door in and saw no one you knew, you asked the tenants downstairs and learned that [Mrs. Ruan]'s family still lived upstairs.
You asked again whether [Mrs. Ruan] is at home? The tenant said that [Mrs. Ruan] was brought back by a fisherman with her luggage not long ago, and she should be upstairs now. The tenant's wife came out and added that [Mrs. Ruan] was washing her hair upstairs after she came back... At this time, someone called you from behind, and you turned around and saw [Guilang].
[Guilang] excitedly pulled you upstairs and took you to his room (young master’s room) - the floor around the stairs on the second floor is very old, and it makes a sound when you walk up. - After you go upstairs, go to the east side of the stairs and see Went downstairs to [Wangdi]. You said you wanted to see [Zhaonan], [Guilang] took you to knock on the door of "sister's room", but there was no response...
[Guilang] said that the eldest sister might have gone out, and took you to his room and put down his luggage. You also said you wanted to see his mother - [Guilang] looked happy and took you out of the "young master's room" and walked to "I should recognize his mother's voice, you answered your name. [Mrs. Ruan] Asked what's the matter with you again?
You asked [Guilang] to go back to his room first, and you wanted to talk to [Mrs. Ruan] alone. The reason why you didn't let [Guilang] accompany you was because you wanted to return "Swan Tears" to his mother, and then you You don’t want to tell [Ms. Ruan] about your deeper relationship with [Guilang] - you no longer want to take it out on [Guilang] at this time, and you even feel that you feel sorry for this young man the way you treated [Guilang] before. It’s best not to hurt him. reject him.
You see [Guilang] went back to the "young master's room", so he told the people in the room that you were here to return the things, and [Mrs. Ruan] asked you to put the things on the table in the room.
You opened the door and walked into the "wife's room" and saw that the room was lit with candles. Before you took out the necklace, you heard something falling in the bathroom, and then there was no movement. You called "Mrs. Ruan" softly and waited for a while, but there was still no response from the bathroom.
You carefully opened the bathroom door, because there was candlelight in the outer room, and you immediately saw [Mrs. Ruan] lying barefoot on the ground, with a bench under her head, water and a piece of soap on the ground - Mrs. Ruan staring. ,like a statue!
You were frightened and didn't go back to the bathroom. You turned around and ran out. Your first thought was to find [Zhaonan]. After you came out of the "wife's room", you pushed the door of the "sister's room" on the right side. You... Only to find that the door was not locked, he opened the door and entered the house.
There was no one in the "sister's room", only luggage. There was a piece of paper with writing on the table, and a pen pressed on the paper. You close the door, pick up the pen and "that piece of paper", and through the moonlight outside the window, you can see clearly what is written on the paper: I don't want to live after my lover dies...
When you see this, you are shocked. You immediately skip the middle content and move your eyes to the end of the text. You see that the signature is "Ruan Zhaonan's last writing" and the date is "September 20, the third year of the Republic of China"!
At this time, you heard someone running in the corridor outside the house, so you hurriedly took the pen and the "suicide note" and came out of the "sister's room". You didn't dare to go to the "wife's room" anymore, and wanted to find [Wangdi] on the opposite side. After confirming her sister's affairs, she heard a man's voice outside the door of the "sister's room" saying:... I can't wait until your mother agrees... What else did the man's voice mention after that? The old way", "...I'll kill you..."!
You were frightened one after another and could only run back to the "young master's room" and told [Guilang] that his mother might be dead and his eldest sister was going to commit suicide... [Guilang] didn't understand for a moment, and you were so anxious that you What he just said was repeated loudly.
[Guilang] Only then did he understand what you meant - his face turned pale and he panicked - then you heard someone running in the corridor, who seemed to be going downstairs.
At about 21:00, you heard someone knocking on the door outside, so you walked out with [Guilang] and saw [Xue Yan] outside the door of "Guest Room 1" on the east side of the corridor on the second floor - the person who knocked on the door was Yi Brother [Qi Gu Fei], he was dragging [Luo Younuo]-[Wangdi] who smelled of alcohol out of her room (sister's room).
He hurriedly walked to his adopted brother and whispered to him: "Mrs. Ruan is also dead. Zhaonan probably committed suicide..."
