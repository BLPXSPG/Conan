story background
September 21, 1914 (the third year of the Republic of China)
After the outbreak of World War I, the imperial powers were busy on the European battlefield, but they still did not forget to split China and absorb China!
In the 34th year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty (1908), the entire "Shanghai-Nanjing Railway" was opened to traffic. Zhenjiang, which passed along the way, had been opened up as a concession by the British as early as 1861. In 1911, the Ministry of Industry Bureau of the British Concession occupied Jiangxi in front of the concession. Set up a fence along the road.
The terrain near Zhenjiang is high in the west and low in the east. There are many rivers. One of them is called "Baiwu River" because white migratory birds stay on it every year. There is a small Western-style building in the south of "White Bird River", which houses residents. A widowed Mrs. Ruan rents out the empty house of "Ruan House" all year round...
your story
Your full name is [Luo Younuo] and you were born in the 17th year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty (1891). Although your father [Luo Wanli] was a scholar, he never got any fame. After marriage, he lived in a shabby house by the river and earned money as a private school teacher. Liang, I have taught you and your sister [Xue Yan] how to read since childhood.
When you were 5 years old (1895), your hometown was hit by a flood. Your mother (Sun) passed away and your home was destroyed. Your father took you and your sister to flee the famine and went to nearby Zhenjiang. Since there was no place to live, he rented the "Ruan House". "house, living in "Guest Room 1" on the second floor.
Your dad still had to prepare for the exam. Seeing that he was working so hard, the landlord [Mrs. Ruan] gave you the "Guest Room 2" opposite, so that your dad could move in and concentrate on studying, and neither you nor your sister could disturb you.
At that time, [Mrs. Ruan]’s youngest daughter [Wangdi] was born not long ago. You and your sister often visited her, and you also met Mrs. Ruan’s eldest daughter [Zhaonan].
The next year (1896), [Mrs. Ruan] gave birth to a son [Guilang] - as the only male in [Mrs. Ruan]'s family, [Guilang] was regarded as a treasure by his mother and sister from the moment he was born. 【Guilang】When I grew up, I followed your father in studying and literacy... your father continued to fail in his attempts and became more and more discouraged.
When you were 12 years old (1902), there was a dance teacher renting a house on the first floor. He took a boy [Qi Gu Fei] and a girl [Hei Li] with him and often went to the hall on the first floor to train the two of them to dance. [Zhaonan] often She went to see and learn from them - the dance teacher praised [Zhaonan] for being very talented, but [Mrs. Ruan] didn't take it seriously until she heard that foreigners in the "British Concession" in Zhenjiang often held dance parties, and girls who danced well also You may only agree to study at [Zhaonan] if you are invited.
When you were 13 years old (1903), at the beginning of the second lunar month, your father suddenly left without saying goodbye and never came back. He seemed to be in a hurry when he left, and took nothing with him. He left you and your sister in the "Ruan House". Listen to He said he still owed the rent - [Mrs. Ruan] adopted you and your sister, and asked you to help her do hard work. Your sister did the laundry, and kept the house where your family lived, and did not rent it to anyone else... because When your father was away, [Mrs. Ruan] sent [Guilang] to study in Zhenjiang City and picked him up every day.
One day, you saw [Zhaonan] and [Wangdi] having an argument. [Zhaonan] pulled something off [Wangdi]’s head and stepped on it severely. Maybe she would look good wearing this - [Wangdi] was big When you start crying, you run out quickly, pick wild flowers in the woods to the west, and make a wreath.


You brought the garland back and gave it to [Wangdi], but she was still sad... You saw that [Wangdi] was sad and felt bad, so you ran to the east woods to find more beautiful flowers - you walked into the forest Deep down, I saw a sea of ​​flowers blooming, but when I encountered a wild beast, I had no choice but to flee back with my life, not daring to go in again.
The next day, you went to [Zhaonan] and told her that she shouldn't bully her sister. Unexpectedly, [Zhaonan] lost her temper when she saw you and forbade you to get close to her sister again!
You were very angry and scolded [Zhaonan] for not being worthy of being [Wangdi]’s sister! [Zhaonan] was very sad after hearing this and became silent. From then on, she always stayed alone in her room on the second floor. She only went downstairs when practicing and focused all her energy on learning to dance. Except for her brother [Guilang], There seems to be nothing more important.
Later, when you guys got a little older, [Xue Yan] always said she wanted to leave here...
A few years later (1908), you finally took your sister away from "Ruan's House"... You went to "Jinghu Lake" to fish, then sold it in the city, and used the money in exchange to rent a house by the lake and settle down - Because the rented place is too small, there is not much space left after putting two beds, so you can only leave dad's things in the "Ruan House".
In 1911, the Ministry of Industry Bureau of the "British Concession" in Zhenjiang occupied the riverside road in front of the concession, built a new Western-style building inside, and recruited maids - the younger sister was literate. After seeing the notice, she applied for the job and was hired to work in foreigners' homes - although The maid works hard, she doesn't have a few days off a year, and she has to live in a foreigner's house, but [Xue Yan] has earned wages since then, and she also helps you introduce fish to the kitchen specially for this family, and delivers it every few days. , even if you don’t catch fish that day, you can buy it from other fishermen and then sell it to foreign chefs.
From then on, you often came to deliver fish and went in through the back door. Sometimes you would go out of the kitchen and look at the interior of foreign houses in the corridor.
In the first year of the Republic of China (1912), you cut off your pigtails and had some savings on hand. You wanted to repay [Mrs. Ruan] who had helped you brothers and sisters. Sometimes you would send extra fish to her without charging any money.
You saw the grown-up [Wangdi] in "Ruan's House" and thought she was even more beautiful than when she was a child, but you had no chance to talk to her... In September, you heard that [Wangdi] was raped by her sister [Zhaonan] Brought to Shanghai.
Soon after, you went to deliver fish again and saw a well-dressed young man bringing a lot of things to [Mrs. Ruan]. After the man left, you heard [Mrs. Ruan] happily say that this man came to propose marriage, and she You have already agreed to marry your daughter to him... You were surprised, fearing that the other party wanted to marry [Wangdi], but fortunately [Mrs. Ruan] said that the person wanted to marry [Zhaonan].
About a week later, the man brought a big red sedan chair to "Ruan's house" to get married. You also followed to watch the fun, but didn’t see [Wangdi] in the crowd. You heard that she fell ill. You were very worried about [Wangdi] and wanted to take advantage of the opportunity of sending fish to visit “Ruan’s house”, but you were stopped by [Mrs. . Ruan] stopped him downstairs.
Last year (1913), my sister came back from vacation. She was a little distracted and often took out a book to read. You glanced at it and saw that the cover said "White Bird Lake" - when you saw "White Bird", you thought of "White Bird" again. [Wangdi] in the "Ruan House" on the bank of the river... When you are fishing, you will hold the boat upstream and sail into the "White Bird River", looking at the second floor of the "Ruan House", I look forward to seeing [Wangdi] in the window one day.
This year (1914), your wish finally came true - that day when the grass grew by the "White Bird River" and warblers were flying, you saw [Wangdi] sitting by the window of her house (sister's room), letting her hair grow long Hanging out the window... You yelled her name in surprise and kept waving - [Wangdi] recognized you and smiled at you, but you saw the tears on her cheeks.
You parked the boat on the river facing the window, held on as hard as you could, and asked [Wangdi] from across the river bank if you were feeling better? [Wangdi] nodded. You also said that you wanted to come to visit her several times, but [Mrs. Ruan] disagreed... After hearing these words, [Wangdi] was a little moved and chatted with you at the window, which made you very happy. ·····
After that, you will go fishing in the "White Bird River" every day. Whenever you see [Wangdi] appear by the window, you will row the boat there. There are very few opportunities for you to get along with each other, and [Wangdi] is recuperating in the room. Every time You can only talk across the river bank...
Once when you met [Wangdi], she asked you to tie the boat to a short tree on the shore, put one end of the rope outside, and asked you to grab it and climb into the house. After you entered the house, you looked at the other side of the rope. One end is tied to the leg of the bed, [Wangdi] is sitting on the bed, her cheeks are flushed, looking at you expectantly... You and [Wangdi] quickly become intimate - you use your passion to make 【Wangdi】I know how much you love her!
Although love is beautiful, [Wangdi] does not dare to let you stay in her room for too long. After you climb out of the window, [Wangdi] will hide the rope and wait for the next opportunity.
On August 11, after you and [Wangdi] made love, you said you wanted to propose marriage, but [Wangdi] lowered her head and whispered that her mother would not agree. Then [Wangdi] asked you to go down, and told you not to let it go. People know about you - you have already made up your mind, but you did not listen to [Wangdi].
You rowed the boat back to the lake, first went to deliver fish to the concession, and then bought gifts in the city. In the evening, you met [Mrs. Ruan] returning with luggage on the way back.
You help [Mrs. Ruan] get her luggage and take her back to "Ruan's House". You notice that [Mrs. Ruan] didn't say a word on the way, just sighed, as if she was sad about something.
When you arrived at the door of "Ruan's House", you handed the gift and luggage to [Mrs. Ruan]. [Mrs. Ruan] asked you what you meant, and you told her that you wanted to marry [Wangdi].
After [Mrs. Ruan] understood, she was stunned for a moment, then immediately shook her head and said that she could not let [Wangdi] marry anyone casually. You refused to give up and said you would agree to it no matter what the conditions were! [Mrs. Ruan] Just say that she needs one hundred silver dollars right now. Can you give it?
One hundred silver dollars was a lot of money to you, but you were not frightened and agreed on the spot - [Mrs. Ruan] said that if you could come up with the money, she would consider it... ··After you got home, you thought about it and finally you could only think of asking your sister for help.
On the morning of August 12th, you carried two fresh fish and went to the "British Concession" in Zhenjiang. As soon as you walked into the concession, you saw [Wangdi] and immediately called her out - [Wangdi] turned around and saw you, and again Happy and surprised.
You didn’t dare to tell [Wangdi] that you were going to propose marriage without telling her, so you just said that you came to see your sister [Xue Yan] who was working as a maid in the concession. You also said that [Xue Yan] and [Wangdi] hadn’t seen each other for a long time, and you wanted to bring [Wangdi] with you. 】Go and see her.
[Wangdi] couldn't resist your request and agreed to go to see [Xue Yan] with you first. On the way, he told you not to reveal your relationship with her - you were going to talk to your sister about borrowing money after [Wangdi] left.
You take [Wangdi] in through the back door of the foreigner's house, go to the kitchen first to put down the fish, and then find [Xue Yan] in the corridor outside the kitchen - you didn't expect that [Wangdi]'s brother [Guilang] is talking to [Xue Yan] Words - At this time, there is a man and a woman in the corridor. You recognize them as [Qi Gu Fei] and [Hei Li] who once rented on the first floor of "Ruan House".


August 12, 10:00 (corridor outside the kitchen) greetings
You must do the following "performances" at this stage and you can also ask what you want to know
1. You have to hide your relationship with [Wangdi] and that you have been to her room - you tell everyone that you met on the road and you took her to see your sister.
2. You cannot let [Wangdi] know that you are asking for marriage and the "price" her mother has offered you - if someone mentions that you haven't asked for marriage yet, you will say that you haven't planned it yet.
3. You can’t remember what your mother looked like when she was alive. After all, you only met her when you were very young. Later, your father also left you and your sister. At that time, it was all up to [Mrs. Ruan] to take you in, so you are very grateful. 【Mrs. Ruan】.
4. You are not a careful person. You have not cared much about women's clothes since you were a child. Therefore, when you see any changes in your sister, you think it is because the girl has grown up and treat it as a normal thing.
5. You come to deliver fish every few days, and you are familiar with everyone in the kitchen, so you can come and go freely.
The story after the pleasantries
After [Qi Gu Fei] took [Hei Li] away, [Wangdi] said goodbye to [Guilang], you and [Xue Yan] and left the baron's house. [Guilang] did not follow her to her brother-in-law's house.
You drag your sister to a deserted place and say that you need one hundred silver dollars now, and ask her if you can find a way to borrow it... [Xue Yan] Hearing such a large sum of money, he immediately became nervous. You quickly say that this is a major event in your life - you want to use this money to propose!
My sister breathed a sigh of relief, but looked embarrassed again - you continued to ask your sister for help, saying that she was working in a foreigner's house and could borrow it from an acquaintance. [Xue Yan] lowered his head and said that he would try it out and asked you to come back later. After that, he went to work.
Just as you were about to leave through the back door, the chef stopped you and asked you if you knew how to pack the fish? As a fisherman, this kind of thing is not a problem for you. The chef asked you to stay and help him and promised to give you wages. You immediately rolled up your sleeves and started working. Listening to the chef complaining that the housekeeper only hires waiters, he didn’t know that the kitchen was the busiest...
You were busy until afternoon. During this period, your sister didn't know that you hadn't left, and you didn't look for her again. The chef asked you not to go out casually, so you ate something and then sat by the door leading to the corridor to rest.
You were thinking about one hundred silver dollars when you heard a conversation between a man and a woman outside the door. You vaguely heard the man say: "I will definitely get the "Swan Tears", and don't forget to promise me." Things..." Don't be distracted by what the woman said.
Then you heard a man speak again, but this time his voice was very low: "You are my favorite... I regret it so much..." Then the man asked the woman where she lived, but the woman mentioned When the other party arrives, he has a wife...
In the afternoon, the reception started on time. The chef looked for someone anxiously and asked where the new waiter had gone. Desserts and drinks have been left on the dining cart for a long time, and no one came to push them! Later, the chef had no choice but to ask you, who has not been trained, to change into waiter's clothes, push the dining cart to the lobby, and hand it over to any maid or waiter there!
You lowered your head, pushed the dining car into the hall, and saw "Swan Lake" being performed inside. [Hei Li] and [Qi Gu Fei] attracted everyone's attention - you didn't see your sister or [Guilang], a service The student took the dining car over - you were afraid that you would make a mistake, so you hurried out of the hall and returned to the kitchen. The chef asked you if the show had started? You nodded. The chef was not so busy now and started chatting with you... After that, you saw [Hei Li] and [Qi Gu Fei] leaving from the back door.
After a while, someone pushed the dining cart outside the kitchen door. You went to the corridor to pick it up and saw [Guilang] coming out of the room on the side of the corridor holding an English sword with a guard... ··The chef then paid you your wages, took you to the next room, and asked you to take off the temporary waiter's clothes and change them into your own. After the chef explained these things, he went out.
After you changed your clothes and returned to the kitchen, you saw your sister waiting for you - [Xue Yan] pulled you outside, took out something wrapped in a handkerchief, and told you that the thing inside was worth at least a hundred silver dollars and was from the boss from Shanghai. I brought it back. I heard that she needed it urgently, so I lent it to her first.
You were happy in your heart, and without thinking too much, you took your things and left the "British Concession". When you returned to your residence, you opened your handkerchief and saw a necklace with drop-shaped gems wrapped inside.
On August 13th, you left the handkerchief on the table at home, took the necklace to "Ruan's house", handed it to [Mrs. Ruan] in person, and told her that it was worth at least one hundred silver dollars.


[Mrs. Ruan] was doubtful and said that she would have to wait until she had someone identify it before she knew. You immediately added that it was high-end goods from Shanghai - [Mrs. Ruan] said that's fine, and asked me when I go to Shanghai. .
After all, what you brought was not cash, and you didn’t dare to be too sure of the price, so you put down your things and asked [Mrs. Ruan] when will you go to Shanghai?
[Mrs. Ruan] said it might be this week or next month - if you are not worried, just take the things back... You said don't worry, of course you are not! Then you leave "Ruan's House" and prepare to come back a few days later.
You continued to fish as usual and were sent to the Baron's house. The chef had a good impression of you and would chat with you every time he saw you. Once, you heard the chef talk about the death of "Mr. Wang" who worked for the Baron. Well, at noon the day after the cocktail party, the body was found in the alley behind the "Yue Wang Hotel" outside the concession... It seemed that it had been robbed...
You waited for more than a week and then went to "Ruan's House" to find [Ms. Ruan]. Seeing that she still had not gone to Shanghai, you said that if you were worried, you would take your things back... You guys You haven’t seen [Wangdi] for days, and [Mrs. Ruan] had this attitude after accepting the things, which made you very upset. After you left "Ruan's House", you went to buy wine, put it in the wine gourd with you, and took it I went back to the fishing boat to drink to drown my sorrows. After drinking too much, I looked at the lake and cursed [Mrs. Ruan] for not keeping her promise, and the damn cheap wine, so bad to drink...
Yesterday (September 20), as usual, you went fishing in the "White Bird River" and saw that the windows of "Sister's Room" and "Guest Room 1" were both open, and [Wangdi] was by the window in her room. , you immediately call her loudly.
[Wangdi] poked his head out after hearing this. While waving to her, you asked her if her mother was at home? [Wangdi] shook his head and said that his mother went to Shanghai to see his younger brother and might come back tomorrow.
When you heard that [Mrs. Ruan] finally went to Shanghai, you felt very happy and wanted to go up and find [Wangdi]. [Wangdi] said that her sister is back, and she is very sad now. She has to go to accompany her... You are a little disappointed, but on second thought, as long as [Mrs. Ruan] confirms the value of the necklace, she can agree with you and It’s [Wangdi]’s business.
You saw that [Wangdi] was not in good spirits, so you said: "You should also go out for a walk, don't stay in the house all day - I'm by the lake, you can find me there!"
[Wangdi] smiled and said that he would definitely go. You thought that [Mrs. Ruan] was not at home, and [Wangdi] would surely come to see you soon, so you had no intention of fishing, so you sailed the fishing boat back to the lake, went home, cleaned the house, and put the two beds together. , put on the bedding and two pillows, then went out, sat on the fishing boat, stared outside, waiting for [Wangdi]...
It was getting late, and you met [Qi Gu Fei] by the lake, and took the initiative to say hello to him. Seeing that [Qi Gu Fei] was carrying luggage, you jokingly asked him if he was going to rent a house at "Ruan House"? [Qi Gu Fei] said that he came to Zhenjiang on a business trip and could not rent a hotel. He wanted to find a house to rent here for a few days.
You know that there is only "Ruan House" for long-term rentals nearby, but I heard that all the rooms there are fully rented. You tell [Qi Gu Fei] this, and you think [Wangdi] won't come today, so you say it's too late today. It's getting late. If [Qi Gu Fei] doesn't mind, I'll stay at your house. [Qi Gu Fei] After hesitating for a moment, he apologized for disturbing you and said he would pay your rent.
You took [Qi Gu Fei] to your residence by the lake - [Qi Gu Fei] saw that the house was clean and asked you if you were married? You can only smile and say: Soon, it will be soon. Then you moved some space in the house for [Qi Gu Fei] to put his luggage, and gave him the key to the door lock. Afterwards, you had dinner together and drank some wine - after drinking too much, you fell asleep on the made-up bed with [Qi Gu Fei].
Today (September 21st), early in the morning, you took the oil lamp and took a boat to the lake to fish. Then you went to the "White Bird River", but you didn't see [Wangdi] open the window...you When I got home after fishing, [Qi Gu Fei] had locked the door and went out, but her luggage was still in the house.
As usual, you went to deliver fish to the concession, but you heard the chef say that your sister resigned. You quickly asked him when it happened, and the chef said that it was after you delivered the fish last time. You thought about it and it must have been the day before yesterday. (September 19). You don’t know what happened. Your sister didn’t come home. You are a little annoyed. You feel that you have been thinking about [Wangdi] all day long and did not pay attention to your sister’s situation... After you left the concession, you walked around , I saw a notice posted on the wall outside the concession looking for clues to the murderer of [Wang Zimo].
After 17:00, you met Mrs. Ruan at the train station and helped her carry her luggage back to "Ruan's House". On the way, you asked her if she had inquired about the price of the necklace when she went to Shanghai?
[Mrs. Ruan] said that she is very satisfied with the necklace, but she can’t marry [Wangdi] to you now. Why don’t you ask her? [Mrs. Ruan] said: "Wangdi's brother-in-law was killed - Wangdi has to take care of her sister during this period - if you really think about Wangdi, why not help her find the real murderer of my son-in-law... .." You feel that [Mrs. Ruan] is arrogant and untrustworthy, but there is nothing you can do about it.
You sent [Mrs. Ruan] back to the door of "Ruan's House" and said that you wanted to go in to see [Wangdi], but [Mrs. Ruan] said that she sweated a lot along the way and wanted to wash her hair, and [Wangdi] wanted to help her. Boil water. You were turned away again and felt unhappy, so you threw away [Mrs. Ruan]’s luggage and returned to your home by the lake, but you didn’t see [Qi Gu Fei].
At about 19:00, when the red sun is about to set, you suddenly see [Wangdi] and a woman in black wearing a veiled hat coming to the lake - [Wangdi] comes to you and says that he wants to borrow your boat so that his sister can relax. -You agreed immediately. After watching [Wangdi] help the woman in black get on the boat, the woman in black gave [Wangdi] a piece of paper filled with words. [Wangdi] told her something in her ear, and then Black The woman in clothes rowed the boat to the lake alone.
[Wangdi] then ran to you, pulled you to hide in a deserted place and kissed you passionately - and then [Wangdi] said that her sister was very sad after the death of her brother-in-law and wanted to be alone... You... Shi wanted to tell her about the betrothal gift, but saw that [Wangdi] was worried about her sister, so she endured it.
[Wangdi] said that she would go back to boil hot water for her mother to wash her hair, and asked you to take her back to the "Ruan's House". As she walked back, her heart was filled with the tenderness between [Wangdi] and you just now, and she wished she could take her right away. Take it home.
At about 20:00, you went to the town and bought a bottle of wine, walked to the fork in the woods, looked at the "Ruan House" from a distance, and drank all the wine... Then you took advantage of the wine, Run into "Ruan's House", go upstairs and rush to "Sister's Room"
-The floor around the stairs on the second floor is very old, and it makes noise when you walk up it. -You don't care about this, you just want to take [Wangdi] home to spend the night tonight!
[Wangdi] in the "sister's room" was startled when she saw you pushing the door open and entering the house. You immediately hugged her and said that you missed her so much... You couldn't wait for her mother to agree... ···【Wangdi】I didn’t understand what you meant for a while, so you said you would follow the “old method” to pick her up and take her to your home, and then said something like you missed her to death - your “old method” was Use the boat to pick up [Wangdi] and take her back to your home, but you didn’t realize that you were too excited just now and forgot to ask [Wangdi] if her sister was back, and even forgot that [Qi Gu Fei] was at home... ···After you finished speaking, you ran out of the "sister's room" and prepared to go back and implement the "old method".
You ran downstairs and saw [Qi Gu Fei] running into "Ruan's House" from outside the door - he stopped you and asked why you came here? You hesitated, not knowing how to answer.


At about 21:00, you were pulled upstairs by [Qi Gu Fei], knocking on the door one by one, and calling everyone out. [Guilang] and [Hei Li] came out from the "young master's room" together, your sister [Xue Yan] came out from the "guest room one", and [Wangdi] came out from the "sister room" - [Qi Gu Fei] pulled you, looking Said anxiously: "Zhaonan is dead!" After hearing this, [Hei Li] hurriedly walked to [Qi Gu Fei] - you heard her whisper to [Qi Gu Fei]: "Mrs. Ruan is also dead, Zhaonan probably committed suicide..."
