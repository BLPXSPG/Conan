story background
September 21, 1914 (the third year of the Republic of China)
After the outbreak of World War I, the imperial powers were busy on the European battlefield, but they still did not forget to split China and absorb China!
In the 34th year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty (1908), the entire "Shanghai-Nanjing Railway" was opened to traffic. Zhenjiang, which passed along the way, had been opened up as a concession by the British as early as 1861. In 1911, the Ministry of Industry Bureau of the British Concession occupied Jiangxi in front of the concession. Set up a fence along the road.
The terrain near Zhenjiang is high in the west and low in the east. There are many rivers. One of them is called the "White Bird River" because white migratory birds stay on it every year. There is a small Western-style building in the south of the "White Bird River", which houses residents. A widowed Mrs. Ruan rents out the empty house of "Ruan House" all year round...
your story
Your full name is [Luo Xue Yan] and you were born in the 19th year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty (1893). Although your father [Luo Wanli] was a scholar, he never received any honors. After marriage, he lived in a shabby house by the river and worked as a private school teacher. Earn food and teach you and your brother [Luo Younuo] how to read since childhood.
When you were 3 years old (1895), your hometown was hit by a flood. Your mother (Sun) passed away and your home was destroyed. Your father took your brother and you to flee the famine and went to nearby Zhenjiang. Because there was no place to live, he rented the "Ruan House" "house, living in "Guest Room 1" on the second floor.
Your dad still had to prepare for the exam. Seeing how hard he worked, the landlord [Mrs. Ruan] gave you the "Guest Room 2" opposite, so that your dad could move in and concentrate on studying, and neither you nor your brother could disturb you.
At that time, [Mrs. Ruan]’s little daughter [Wangdi] was born not long ago. My brother and you often visited her, and we also met [Mrs. Ruan]’s eldest daughter [Zhaonan].
The next year (1896), [Mrs. Ruan] gave birth to a son [Guilang] - after becoming [Mrs. Ruan]'s family, he followed your father to study and read... your father still failed in his attempts. , becoming more and more discouraged.
When you were 10 years old (1902), there was a dance teacher who rented a house on the first floor. He took a boy [Qi Gu Fei] and a girl [Hei Li] with him and often went to the hall on the first floor to train the two of them to dance. [Zhaonan] often She went to see and learn from them - the dance teacher praised [Zhaonan] for being very talented, but [Mrs. Ruan] didn't take it seriously until she heard that foreigners in the "British Concession" in Zhenjiang often held dance parties, and girls who danced well also Maybe you agreed to learn [Zhaonan] only after being invited - After you heard about it, you were very envious of the girls who could go to the dance, so you secretly imitated it and practiced in secret.
When you were 11 years old (1903), at the beginning of the second lunar month, your father suddenly left without saying goodbye and never came back. He seemed to be in a hurry when he left, and took nothing with him. He left your brother and you in the "Ruan House". She said she still owed the rent - [Mrs. Ruan] adopted her brother and you, and asked her brother to help her with the hard work, and you did the laundry, and kept the house where your family lived, and did not rent it to anyone else...because When your father was away, [Mrs. Ruan] sent [Guilang] to study in Zhenjiang City and picked him up every day.
Your destiny has changed since then, and you have become a servant to [Mrs. Ruan]’s mother and daughter. Only your brother and you depend on each other...


Before your father disappeared, [Zhaonan] often played with you, but now she has new friends and is with the dancers. Even if she sees you, she will turn her head and ignore you - you because [ Zhaonan's indifference is sad, but something more egregious is yet to come...
One day, you saw [Wangdi] wearing a "hairpin" on her head, which looked very much like your mother's relic, so you ran back to "Guest Room 1" where your brother and you lived to search for your luggage, and sure enough you couldn't find it - you wanted to follow [ Wangdi] Wanted to take back your mother's belongings, but saw her and her sister together - [Zhaonan] threw the "hairpin" to the ground and stepped on it like a prank...
You waited until [Zhaonan] and [Wangdi] walked away before you dared to run over. When you saw the trampled "hairpin", you cried heartbrokenly. Your brother was not in the room at this time, and no one came to comfort you... ···You can only wipe away your tears, pick up your mother's relics, and dare not tell your brother about it. After that, you told your brother more than once that you wanted to leave here...
A few years later (1908), your brother finally took you away from "Ruan's House"... He went to "Jinghu Lake" to fish, then sold it in the city, and used the money in exchange to rent a house by the lake and settle down - Because the rented place is too small, there is not much space left after putting two beds, so you can only leave dad's things in the "Ruan House".
You and your brother lived in the same room at that time. Although you slept in two beds, you still found it very inconvenient - your brother was not as meticulous about many things as you were, and he didn't realize that you were no longer a little girl.
In 1911, the Ministry of Industry and Industry Bureau of the "British Concession" in Zhenjiang occupied the riverside road in front of the concession and built a new western-style building inside. They were recruiting maids. You saw the notice and applied for the job. You were hired by a housekeeper named "Baron Smith". Employment - Although the maid works hard and doesn't have a few days off in a year, you can live in a foreigner's house and get paid... You introduce your brother to provide fish for the kitchen of this house, so that you can work hard every day. He can also earn more by fishing. My brother often comes to deliver fish, and he always comes in through the back door. Sometimes he goes out of the kitchen and looks at the interior of a foreign house in the corridor.
You sometimes go shopping in the city outside the concession, and you met [Guilang] who was living and studying in the city. He was young and cute. He was the only member of the "Ruan family" that you didn't hate, so you chatted with him. About your job, you also heard him say that [Zhaonan] went to Shanghai with the dance teacher and others without telling [Mrs. Ruan]...
In the first year of the Republic of China (1912), men cut off their braids. You have seen many people working for foreign bosses in the concessions - among them was a young and handsome Chinese man named [Wang Zimo] who inherited after his parents died. After receiving a large inheritance and his father's real estate in the "British Concession" in Zhenjiang, he now works for "Baron Smith" and often visits the Baron's home.
In the Baron's house, both the housekeeper and the other maids like to get together and chat. You heard a maid say that [Wang Zimo] likes dancing very much... You have been practicing since you heard the story of the dance when you were a child. Watching [Zhaonan] dance, I dream about getting an invitation one day.
Last year (1913), [Wang Zimo] came to the Baron's house for a party one night and stayed overnight as a guest. You bring supper to [Wang Zimo] in the evening, and you see that he is drinking and looking melancholy. Because you have a good impression of [Wang Zimo], regardless of your status as a maid, you take the initiative to ask him why he is unhappy.
[Wang Zimo] I need someone to talk to at this time, so I told you that his marriage is very failed. His wife only asks him for money, and his life is no fun... Then [Wang Zimo] said it There are many "regrets", and he also hopes that you can spend the night with him - you were frightened by this bold invitation and hurried out of the guest room, but there was an inexplicable loss in your heart.
A few days later, [Wang Zimo] quietly found you, apologized to you, and said he wanted to treat you to dinner - you blushed and agreed to him.
[Wang Zimo] took you to a Western restaurant and kept praising your beauty. He even exaggeratedly said that you have the purity of a "white swan" and the enchantment of a "black swan", just like "Cinderella" (Cinderella) in the fairy tale. ·······This is the first time in your life that you have been praised like this by someone, and you can’t help but indulge in it. Under the influence of foreign wine, you no longer care about the other person’s wife. - [Wang Zimo] said he likes dancing, so you just use your smile to say that he likes dancing. drunk, dancing a little for him after leaving the restaurant.
[Wang Zimo] was very happy, and later he asked you out again, told you the story of "Cinderella" (Cinderella) and the "Glass Slipper", and gave you a copy of "White Bird Lake", saying that this is Japan It was adapted from a Russian ballet, and he liked it very much - the prince in it fell in love with a princess, but was seduced by the devil's daughter, deceived by her, and confessed to her... After that the prince Awakened, defeated the devil, and found the one he truly loved.
Although you didn't know Japanese, you still understood the Chinese characters above, so you borrowed a pen and wrote what [Wang Zimo] said on a note - which surprised [Wang Zimo] even more. He said that his wife She doesn’t even know how to read, so it took him a long time to teach her... [Wang Zimo] Your compliments were very helpful to you, and you went shopping with him later... [Wang Zimo] By Give you a chance to choose clothes, bend down, take off one of your shoes, touch your slender feet, and say that he will customize a pair of the most suitable dancing shoes for you - you blush, hearing this man even swear that he loves you After falling in love with you, if he can't divorce you and marry you, he will die...
You believed [Wang Zimo]’s words and asked him to take away one of your shoes, but you still couldn’t wait for him to fulfill his promise. When you went back to see your brother during the vacation, you had already begun to worry that [Wang Zimo] was not in love with you. ······You were uneasy, afraid of being noticed by your brother, so you took out "White Bird Lake" and kept flipping through it, making up your mind not to let [Wang Zimo] take advantage of him before the divorce - you don't believe empty words. It’s a promise without foundation, not to mention he didn’t even give you the dancing shoes he promised!
This year (1914), in August, "Baron Smith" went to Shanghai. After returning, he planned to hold a cocktail party at home to raise money for the charity sale of the British troops participating in the "World War" in Europe... The cocktail party There were also dancers invited from Shanghai's "Traveling Bird Theater" to perform "Swan Lake". In order to ensure the smooth progress of this important reception, the housekeeper advertised in the newspaper to temporarily recruit waiters and provided special training.
On August 9, [Wang Zimo] came to the Baron's house and stayed in the guest room on the second floor to help prepare for the reception.
On August 11, you saw [Guilang] among the waiters. He said he came here to work and study.
In the evening, you went out to buy things and saw [Guilang] walking out of the rental area and going to a "Yue Wang Hotel".
In the evening, [Wang Zimo] asks you to deliver wine to the guest room where he lives. After you entered, he took off your hat and then pulled you to the bed to make love... You kept shaking your head to resist, making [Wang Zimo] unable to succeed. After that, you said that you still had a job and picked up the hat. Run downstairs.
On the morning of August 12th, [Guilang] quietly called you to the corridor outside the kitchen and asked you about the reception and auction. You didn’t know the situation at the reception, so you could only tell you about the performance of "Swan Lake" He - At this time you saw your brother coming out of the kitchen with a woman - even though you haven't seen her for many years, you still recognized this woman as [Wangdi] (she doesn't look like Zhaonan, but she is also very beautiful)!
At this time, there was a man and a woman in the corridor. They were [Qi Gu Fei] and [Hei Li] who used to rent downstairs in the "Ruan House".


August 12, 10:00 (corridor outside the kitchen) greetings
You must do the following "performances" at this stage and you can also ask what you want to know
1. Because [Wang Zimo] is still not divorced, you have to hide your relationship with him.
2. You heard from the butler that the auction items at the reception were all jewelry that the baron brought back from his store in Shanghai.
3. You and other people haven’t seen each other for a long time. You can ask them how they are doing.
4. You have to say bitterly that you actually like dancing, but your mother died when you were a child, and you lost your father. When you were a child, you relied on [Mrs. . Ruan]’s two daughters are well-dressed - [Zhaonan] can also learn to dance...
5. Because your brother has not married yet, you cannot consider marrying yourself yet - you think your brother is too trusting and you are worried that he will be deceived (you have to protect your honest brother).
The story after the pleasantries
After [Qi Gu Fei] took [Hei Li] away, [Wangdi] said goodbye to [Guilang], brother and you, and left the baron's house. [Guilang] did not follow her to her brother-in-law's house.
Your brother pulled you to a deserted place and said that he needed a hundred silver dollars now, and asked you if you could find a way to borrow it... When you heard about such a large sum of money, you immediately became nervous. The elder brother quickly said that this was a major event of his lifetime - he would use the money to propose marriage!
You were relieved to hear that it was not a debt, but you didn't know how to help your brother. Your brother continued to beg you for help, saying that you were working in a foreigner's house after all, so you could borrow it from an acquaintance.
You lowered your head. Although it was difficult, you still said that you would try it out and asked your brother to come over later. After saying that [Wang Zimo]... you walked upstairs and knocked on [Wang Zimo]’s room. At the door of the guest room, you saw that the person who opened the door was [Guilang] - you said you were here to clean up the room, but [Guilang] said that no disturbance is allowed in the room now... You looked at him doubtfully, [Guilang] Just whisper in your ear that there is a woman in the house...
【Guilang】With such a sneaky look, the woman in question is naturally not 【Wang Zimo】's wife... You felt your heart was hurt deeply, but you couldn't show it in front of 【Guilang】, so you had to turn around and leave. When you walked downstairs, tears were already flowing down your face, and you felt hatred from the bottom of your heart.
You hid in a place where no one could see you and cried for a long time, not daring to let your brother know - you knew what your brother was like, and he couldn't just sit back and watch you being bullied and remain indifferent.
In the afternoon, the reception started on time. When you saw people coming and going in the hall, you remembered to do something, so you went to the bathroom to wash your face, tidy up your clothes, and walked back to the hall to work. There were many people in the hall, watching "The Swan" Lake", [Hei Li] and [Qi Gu Fei] attracted everyone's attention. You who have loved dancing since you were a child can't help but keep your eyes on them...
In the last scene of the show, although the "Prince" vowed to save his lover from the Devil, his confession to the "Black Swan" allowed the Devil's curse to take effect, and the "White Swan" died in pain after losing his lover... and The "Black Swan" with the same appearance as the "White Swan" is also played by [Hei Li]. She puts on a black dance dress in the penultimate scene. In contrast to the pure beauty of the previous scene, she uses dance to seduce the "prince" who cannot tell the truth. , every gesture is full of enchantment...
The audience applauded the performance, and "Baron Smith" began to take out jewelry for auction. A drop-shaped gem necklace worn by [Hei Li] during the performance was also one of the auction items.
[Wang Zimo] then bought the necklace for a transaction price of one hundred and fifty silver dollars. [Hei Li] smiled, took off the necklace and handed it to him. [Wang Zimo] took the necklace and whispered to [Hei Li] said something... At this time, you no longer feel sad for [Wang Zimo]'s behavior, but think that this necklace worth one hundred and fifty silver dollars can help your brother.
After that, [Qi Gu Fei] and [Hei Li] went to remove their makeup, and [Wang Zimo] also walked out of the hall and stood outside the door on the side of the corridor with a necklace.
You picked up a glass of wine, walked quickly to [Wang Zimo], handed it to him and asked him if he wanted to drink. [Wang Zimo] put the necklace in his pocket and took the wine from you. - Seeing that [Wang Zimo] had sweat on his head, he took out the handkerchief given to the maid by the housekeeper to wipe his sweat. - [Wang Zimo]'s attention was not on you, so he didn't notice that you took the opportunity to put your hand into his pocket and steal Gone is the necklace.


After you stole something, you hid until you saw [Wang Zimo] being called back to the hall by the baron, then you went to the kitchen to wait for your brother to come. Soon [Luo Younuo] came to the kitchen, and you pulled him outside the back door and took out Wrap the necklace in a handkerchief and tell him that the thing inside is worth at least one hundred silver dollars and was brought back by the boss from Shanghai... Then you make up a lie and say that the boss heard that you needed it urgently and lent it to you first.
Your brother was very happy. He didn't think much or pay attention to your expression. He picked up the things and left. Only then did you let out a sigh of relief. In addition to helping your brother, you also wanted to take revenge on the man who cheated on you! [Wang Zimo] hasn’t been to the Baron’s house since then. You swore to forget this man, but it backfired...
A month later (September), a woman wearing a hat with a black veil and black clothes was invited to the Baron's house. "Baron Smith" personally welcomed her in - a fat maid said that this black woman The woman wearing the clothes must be a widow. You asked why, and the fat maid said you looked at what she was wearing - it was a foreign mourning dress. I heard that "Queen Victoria" wore it at her husband's funeral, and it later became fashionable...
The butler came to get tea at this time. To prove that her guess was right, the fat maid asked the butler who the woman in black was. The housekeeper cleared his throat and told you that the woman in black is [Wang Zimo]'s widow [Ms. Zhaonan]. The baron has visited her before and is watching her inherit her husband's inheritance under the witness of the lawyer...
You suddenly heard that [Wang Zimo] died, and you couldn't help but be shocked. Asked when [Wang Zimo] died? The housekeeper thought for a while and said that on the day after the cocktail party last month, someone found [Wang Zimo]'s body in the alley behind the "Yue Wang Hotel" outside the concession, and all his belongings were robbed. Among them is the "Swan Tears" necklace bought at the reception... Now a reward is being offered to catch the murderer.
When you heard this, you couldn't help but break into a cold sweat, worried that you or your brother would be regarded as a murderer... Later you saw that your brother could still come to deliver fish, so you breathed a sigh of relief, but you went to the city outside the concession. At that time, I saw a notice posted on the wall outside the concession asking for clues to the murderer of [Wang Zimo], and I was very scared. After a few days of fear, you did not dare to stay in the concession anymore and made up your mind to resign.
On the morning of September 19th, after you settled your wages with the housekeeper, you took your belongings and left the concession - you couldn't let your brother know that you had stolen something, and you didn't dare to see him until you figured out how to explain the necklace to him. He needed a safe place to live, so he had to go to "Ruan's House" first, met [Mrs. Ruan], and said he wanted to rent a house with her.
【Mrs. Ruan】Remember when you moved out with your brother, you explained that you are no longer a little girl and you can’t live in the same room with your brother...【Mrs. Ruan】Speaking of you When dad left, he asked her to take care of you brothers and sisters. The house you lived in is still empty...
When you heard this, your nose felt a little sore, and then you followed [Mrs. Ruan] upstairs to "Guest Room 1" - the floor around the stairs on the second floor was very old, and you made a sound when you walked up - "Guest Room 1" had not been in "Guest Room 1" for a long time People have moved in, and dust has accumulated on the furniture.
[Mrs. Ruan] first collected one month's rent from you, gave you the key to "Guest Room 1", and then asked you to clean it yourself - you put your luggage in the house, opened the window, went downstairs to fetch water, and found the "Guest Room 1" opposite 2” still unoccupied.
When you were cleaning the table in the house with a rag, the little girl who lived downstairs came to see you and pestered you to tell her fairy tales. You had no choice but to tell her what you heard from [Wang Zimo] "Cinderella" (Cinderella) story, the little girl left with satisfaction.
After that, you continued to clean the house, and when you were about to go out to fetch water, you saw a black peasant woman wearing a veiled hat going upstairs, carrying her luggage and walking into the "sister room" where [Zhaonan] used to live - your heart suddenly You are getting nervous - you really want to ask her all the information related to [Wang Zimo]'s death, but you don't know how to ask her. The other party is [Wang Zimo]'s wife who is married to the media, and you are just a "vegetarian" with [Wang Zimo]. The woman who has nothing to do with...
Yesterday (September 20th), you had no appetite to eat and felt very sad. Before you were at the Baron’s house, you didn’t dare to think too much about [Wang Zimo]’s death. Now you have time to recall all the stories between you and him. You Even though you know that he is not sincere to you, you still can't forget him.
Suddenly you heard someone shouting [Wangdi] outside the window, so you looked out the window and saw your brother holding a fishing boat in the "White Bird River", waving to this side... You were afraid of being seen by your brother, so you Close the window, hide in bed, toss and turn, and don't fall asleep until dawn.
Today (September 21st), in the afternoon, you woke up and went to the kitchen to get some food. After eating, you walked upstairs and saw the door of your "sister's room" open, so you walked over and saw a girl in black clothes. [Zhaonan] has taken off his veiled hat and is sitting on the bed with a painful expression, tears in the corners of his eyes. [Wangdi] sat next to her sister, hugged [Zhaonan] tightly, and kept comforting her - your impression of [Zhaonan] is still from a long time ago. At this time, you see her face is pale. If you look carefully, her temples There are also a few more strands of white hair...
[Zhaonan] raised his head at this time, and you quickly turned away and walked away. Thinking of [Wang Zimo]'s half-heartedness, you actually sympathized with [Zhaonan].
After 18:00, you saw [Mrs. Ruan] returning upstairs with her luggage. She first went to the "wife's room" to put down her things. She was sweating and wanted to wash her hair in a hurry, so she went to the "sister's room". .
After 19:00, you were restless in "Guest Room 1" and couldn't help but want to find [Zhaonan]. Finally, Oh Lu finally made up his mind and knocked on the door of "Sister's Room", but no one answered. He thought she was with [Zhaonan]. Wangdi] was together, and knocked on the door of the "sister's room" again, but still no one answered - you guessed that the two sisters went out to relax, so they had to go back to the room and lie down on the bed.
After 20:00, you heard movement in the corridor and thought it was [Zhaonan] and [Wangdi] coming back. When you sat up from the bed, you caught a glimpse of lights on the river outside the window. You quietly opened the door and saw it was [Zhaonan] and [Wangdi] coming back. Guilang] and [Hei Li] walked into the "young master's room" and you closed the door.
Soon you heard the sound of the floor in the corridor again, so you opened the door again and saw [Guilang] and [Hei Li] knocking on the door outside the "wife's room". You see it’s not [Zhaonan], so he closed the door again.
You then heard the sound of the floor and knew someone walked into the room next to yours. Then you heard someone running in the corridor. Then you heard running again. You couldn't help but open the door and saw your brother [Luo Younuo] running. Enter the "sister's room"! You were startled and quickly closed the door, worried that your honest brother would tell you about giving him "swan tears"... After that, you heard someone running in the corridor again, and you heard a woman next door saying loudly Your mother may be dead and your eldest sister is going to commit suicide...
At about 21:00, you heard someone knocking on the door outside, so you opened the door and came out. You saw [Guilang] and [Hei Li] coming out of the "young master's room" - the person who knocked on the door was [Qi Gu Fei], and he pulled you The brothers [Luo Younuo] and [Wangdi] smelling of alcohol are coming out of the "sister's room".
[Qi Gu Fei]'s trouser legs and shoes were wet, and he said anxiously: "Zhaonan is dead!" After hearing this, [Hei Li] hurried to [Qi Gu Fei] and whispered to him Said something.
