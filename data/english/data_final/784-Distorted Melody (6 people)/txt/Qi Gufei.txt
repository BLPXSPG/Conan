story background
September 21, 1914 (the third year of the Republic of China)
After the outbreak of World War I, the imperial powers were busy on the European battlefield, but they still did not forget to split China and absorb China!
In the 34th year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty (1908), the entire "Shanghai-Nanjing Railway" was opened to traffic. Zhenjiang, which passed along the way, had been opened up as a concession by the British as early as 1861. In 1911, the Ministry of Industry Bureau of the British Concession occupied Jiangxi in front of the concession. Set up cupboards along the roadside.
The terrain near Zhenjiang is high in the west and low in the east. There are many rivers. One of them is called the "White Bird River" because white migratory birds stay on it every year. There is a small Western-style building in the south of the "White Bird River", which houses residents. A widowed Mrs. Ruan rents out the empty house of "Ruan House" all year round...
your story
Your name is [Gu Fei]. You are an orphan. You were born in the 16th year of Guangxu’s reign in the Qing Dynasty (1890). You were brought up by your adoptive father [Qi Qingli], and you took his surname. Your adoptive father was a dancer who went abroad and was later injured. , and will no longer take the stage. There is also an adopted daughter [Hei Li] (your adopted sister) beside your adoptive father, who is 3 years younger than you. She grew up with you, learned dancing and literacy together, and has more of a kinship than ordinary siblings. .
When you were 13 years old (1902), your adoptive father was introduced by an old classmate who lived in the "British Concession" in Zhenjiang and got a job teaching dance. He took you and [Hei Li] to the "Ruan House" in the east of Zhenjiang. , rented on the first floor
The landlord [Mrs. Ruan] has two daughters [Zhaonan] [Wangdi] and a son [Guilang]. Among them, [Zhaonan] is 1 year younger than you. She often comes to see you and [Hei Li] dance, and also learns from you - The adoptive father praised [Zhaonan] for being very talented, but [Mrs. Ruan] didn't take it seriously. It wasn't until she heard her adoptive father say that foreigners in the "British Concession" in Zhenjiang often held dance parties, and girls who danced well might even be invited, that she agreed [Zhaonan] 】study.
[Hei Li] liked [Zhaonan] very much as soon as they met. He taught her all his experience and practiced with her every day. At that time, there was a [Luo Xiucai] living on the second floor of the "Ruan House". He was very young but had never passed the exam. After gaining fame, he lived in a rented house with his son [Luo Younuo] and daughter [Xue Yan]. Apart from being invited by [Mrs. Ruan] to teach [Guilang] how to read, he had no other livelihood.
[Luo Xiucai] always watches [Hei Li] and [Zhaonan] practicing dance on the second floor when his adoptive father is out... You hate [Luo Xiucai] because of this. You watch him once and then stare at the girls upstairs. Dance and go up and drive him away.
[Luo Xiucai] looked down on you, calling you and your adoptive father "low-life". You almost fought him over this, but [Zhaonan] ran upstairs to stop you - [Zhaonan] said that her mother valued [Luo Xiucai] very much. , you can’t offend him... After listening to [Zhaonan], you saw her timid appearance and wanted to protect her. After that, you observed secretly and saw that [Luo Xiucai] often harassed this girl, and [Zhaonan] only Can avoid as much as possible.
One year later (1903), [Zhaonan] made great progress, and her adoptive father liked [Zhaonan] more and more and often praised her, so [Hei Li] stopped instructing her.
On the second day of the second lunar month, [Zhaonan] suddenly fell down while dancing and twisted her foot. You and [Hei Li] sent her upstairs to her room (sister's room) - you see [Zhaonan] looks very bad, just wait [Hei Li] After going out, she asked in a low voice if "the person named Luo" was bullying her?


【Zhaonan】said in a low voice:······He said I was beautiful and gave me things...I was afraid of him...I didn’t want to see him again······【Zhaonan 】As you say this, you gradually break down in tears - you can't help but have the idea of ​​saving this poor girl and want to get rid of the bad guys for her - you have hoped since you were a child that you can be like the "prince" in the story, killing the "princess" with your own hands. The evil "devil"!
When [Luo Xiucai] appeared outside [Zhaonan]'s house, [Zhaonan] started to tremble again - you can't conflict with [Luo Xiucai] in person, just wait until night to go to him and say [Zhaonan] has an appointment with him early tomorrow morning." We met deep in the woods to the east of "Ruan's House" - [Luo Xiucai] After hearing this, he was very happy and had no doubts at all.
The next day (the third day of the second lunar month), you went to the kitchen and stole a "rolling pin". You went out before dawn and hid in the woods. When [Luo Xiucai] arrived, you knocked him down from behind and took advantage of his absence. Get up and hit him on the head repeatedly with the "rolling pin" until he's dead! You have no way to dispose of the body after killing, so you can only leave it in the woods and cover it with soil and leaves. Fortunately, there are no homes near the woods, and almost no one from the "Ruan House" comes here.
After you returned to "Ruan's House", you imitated [Luo Xiucai] and wrote a "farewell letter" in the tone of "Luo Xiucai". The content was that he was going to Beijing to take the exam and asked "Ms. Ruan" to help him take care of the children, and signed it "Luo Xiucai" ". Then you put the letter outside the door of [Mrs. Ruan]’s house (wife’s room), and saw [Guilang] pick up the letter and send it into the house... Later everyone said that [Luo Xiucai] owed The rent was paid without saying goodbye. [Mrs. Ruan] later adopted [Luo Younuo] and [Xue Yan] to help her with her work.
You didn't tell [Zhaonan] what you did for her - later [Zhaonan] became quiet and always stayed alone in her room on the second floor. She only went downstairs when practicing and focused all her energy on learning to dance. , except for her brother [Guilang], there seems to be nothing more important to you - you fell in love with [Zhaonan] at that time, but you had no chance to express your love to her.
A few years later (1908), [Luo Younuo] took [Xue Yan] to move out of the "Ruan House", and [Guilang] went to live in the city to study. With the opening of the "Shanghai-Nanjing Railway", your adoptive father had the idea of ​​going to Shanghai to start a theater troupe - you didn't expect that [Zhaonan] Jing would leave with you.
You take [Zhaonan] to Zhenjiang. After she meets [Guilang], she will get on the train with you and come to Shanghai, which is known as the "Paris of the East"... The adoptive father established it with the support of his old classmates. "Traveler Theater", you perform the official role, and [Hei Li] and [Zhaonan] act as backup dancers to gain experience.
After you gained income from performances, you often bought [Zhaonan] delicious food and gave her a pair of dancing shoes (normal size), which moved [Zhaonan] very much - life was very difficult in those days, and all you could do was keep working hard every day. Training, but you saw a long-lost smile on [Zhaonan]’s face.
Your relationship with [Zhaonan] is getting closer, but you can’t get closer because of training and performances. [Zhaonan] said that she has a dream to become a heroine on stage and become a star for once - until she realizes it, she dare not think about anything else.
In the first year of the Republic of China (1912), men cut off their braids, and [Hei Li] and [Zhaonan] finally had the opportunity to star on stage - their adoptive father abbreviated "Swan Lake" by the Russian composer "Tchaikovsky" After adapting it for the stage, he hesitated who should play the heroine "White Swan" (Princess Odette).
You recommended [Zhaonan], and your adoptive father arranged for [Hei Li] to play the role of "Black Swan" (the daughter of the devil), and you to play the role of "Prince" - the adoptive father then chose the comedy ending between sad and happy endings: "White Swan" and The "Prince" relies on true love to defeat the "Devil"'s magic and lift the curse.
In the story, the "Black Swan" once disguised himself as a princess, and his adoptive father asked [Hei Li] and [Zhaonan] to wear "black feather masks" and "white feather masks" respectively on the stage. [Zhaonan] wanted to give herself a stage name after listening to the story her adoptive father told her about her role, so you helped her choose "White Bird" which represents "White Swan" - because [Zhaonan] was illiterate, you painted it one stroke at a time Earth taught her how to write "White Bird."
In September, [Zhaonan] said she wanted to tell her family about her performance on stage, so she took leave to go back. Later, she took her sister [Wangdi] back to Shanghai and rented a cheap house near the troupe's residence to live with her sister.
On September 21st, "The Traveling Bird Theater" performed "Swan Lake" for the first time. The dances of [Hei Li] and [Zhaonan] were both extraordinary.
Excellent - you also gave a perfect performance with [Zhaonan] in the last scene.
You and [Zhaonan] were very excited. After coming off the stage, you couldn't help but kiss each other in the corner of the aisle. The feelings you had accumulated for many years burst out at this moment. After that, [Zhaonan] went backstage to change out of his performance clothes and slipped away with you. Go out, come to the Huangpu River, look at the neon lights of "Ten Miles Foreign Market" at night, and start to imagine your future - you beg [Zhaonan] to marry you, but she sheds tears and says that she can only agree to go back and tell her mother. .
You wanted to take [Zhaonan] to a hotel to spend the night together, but [Zhaonan] said that he wanted to accompany his sister, so you had to go back to the troupe's residence alone - when [Zhaonan] separated from you, he mentioned that [Hei Li] finished dancing in the penultimate act After the dance, I got off the stage to take off my makeup. I didn’t see her after that. Is there anything wrong? After you returned to your residence, you found [Hei Li] and saw that she looked depressed. Thinking that you had asked your adoptive father to give [Zhaonan] the chance to be the heroine, you advised your step sister not to be sad because she did not play the role of "White Swan". There will be many opportunities in the future. ······
During the performance the next day, neither [Zhaonan] nor [Hei Li]'s performance was as good as yesterday, so they were left together by their adoptive father and severely criticized - you know that [Zhaonan] was distracted because of your proposal, and [Hei Li] Maybe it’s because [Zhaonan] has ideas about being a heroine... [Zhaonan] didn’t dare to be intimate with you after being criticized. You went to find her after you got off the stage, but she said she was going to the hotel to accompany her sister and wouldn’t come back at night. The troupe's residence.
In November, the performance came to an end. [Zhaonan] is sending his sister back to "Ruan's house", so I came to say goodbye to you - you thought that [Zhaonan] would tell her mother about your marriage when she went back this time... Not long after, the adoptive father received a letter from his old classmate A wedding invitation from his son [Wang Zimo], and a resignation letter written by [Wang Zimo] on behalf of [Zhaonan] - the letter said that not only was [Zhaonan] quitting the troupe, but he was also getting married to [Wang Zimo]!
This news is like a bolt from the blue, which makes you unable to believe it, but you have to accept it... From now on, the troupe will still perform "Swan Lake", but the ending is changed to a tragedy - the "Prince" did not see through the "Devil"'s trick, I can never be with my beloved "White Swan"... "White Swan" died in pain after losing her lover...
Without [Zhaonan], [Hei Li] plays the "White Swan" and the "Black Swan" on the stage alone. Not only does he no longer need a mask, he also performs two completely different temperaments - [Hei Li] in the last scene "Two Acts", full of enchantment in every gesture... The outstanding performance made [Hei Li] gradually famous and had many suitors, but she turned them away one by one. Do you miss [Zhaonan]? Secretly collect the "White Feather Mask" she once used.
This year (1914), you still can't forget [Zhaonan], and in the bottom of your heart you hate the [Wang Zimo] you have never met. In August, the troupe received an invitation to go to the "British Concession" in Zhenjiang and perform at a private reception on August 12. The other party also paid the remuneration in advance - it turned out that at this time, Britain entered the "World War", and there was a "Smith" "The Baron" planned to hold a reception at his home to raise funds for a charity sale for the British troops participating in the war.


On August 11, you and [Hei Li] took the first-class train tickets bought by your adoptive father and took the "Shanghai-Nanjing Line" train (3809 times). After nearly 9 hours, you arrived in Zhenjiang. After getting off the train, you saw that it was getting late. You and [Hei Li] rented a room at the "Yuechang Hostel" outside the "British Concession". You and [Hei Li] each rented a single room.
On August 12th, in the morning, you and [Hei Li] brought your costumes and props to your employer's home in the concession - the reception was in the afternoon. After you and [Hei Li] met the baron, you went to the mansion Walking around on the first floor, I came to the corridor outside the kitchen and saw [Zhaonan]'s brother [Guilang] talking to a girl.
[Hei Li] thinks the girl looks familiar, so you tell her that she is [Xue Yan], the daughter of [Luo Xiucai] who used to live on the second floor of "Ruan House" (you killed Luo Xiucai and remember his children very clearly) .
Then you saw [Xue Yan]’s brother [Luo Younuo] and [Zhaonan]’s sister [Wangdi] walking out of the kitchen together.
August 12, 10:00 (corridor outside the kitchen) greetings
You must do the following "performances" at this stage and you can also ask what you want to know
1. Because [Zhaonan] is already married, you can only hide your past relationship with [Zhaonan] and the fact that you have killed someone for her.
2. You have to praise [Wangdi] - she and her sister are not similar in appearance, but they are both beautiful.
3. You and [Hei Li] will perform "Swan Lake" at the afternoon reception, but according to the contract, the content of the performance and the arrangements for the reception cannot be told to others in advance (Hei Li cannot be told in advance).
4. After you understand the situation, you can say that you need to take [Hei Li] to prepare for the performance and leave the corridor (end of greetings).
The story after the pleasantries
You took [Hei Li] and separated from the others, went to the room on the side of the corridor, and started preparing for the afternoon performance. Before the performance started, a waiter knocked on the door and said that someone outside wanted to see [Hei Li].
[Hei Li] went out for a while, and her face was ugly when she came back, but she quickly adjusted herself - you wear a British "formal sword" (painted wooden prop) as a prop and dress up as a "prince". Noticed that [Hei Li] had a necklace with a drop-shaped gemstone embedded on her neck.
In the afternoon, the performance started on time, and there were many invited guests in the hall. You and [Hei Li] did not pay attention to others and concentrated on presenting a wonderful "Swan Lake" - the last scene of the performance, "Prince" Although he vowed to save his lover from the devil, his confession to the "Black Swan" disguised as a princess made the devil's curse take effect, and the "White Swan" died in pain after losing his lover... Audience reports on the performance With applause, "Baron Smith" began to take out the jewelry for auction.
The necklace worn by [Hei Li] was also one of the auction items. It was bought by a Chinese man for 150 silver dollars. [Hei Li] smiled, took off the necklace and handed it to him - listen to what the man said to [Hei Li] Whispered: "I bought it to give to the woman I love..."
After that, [Hei Li] and you went to the room on the side of the corridor to remove makeup. You casually mentioned what happened just now, and [Hei Li] asked you: "Don't you know the man who bought the necklace? He has been to the troupe's residence before. Wang Zimo, the son of your adoptive father's old classmate." When you heard the name, you felt like your heart was hit hard, and you tried to pretend to be nonchalant. [Hei Li] then asked you to say goodbye in advance, picked up the costumes and props, left the Baron's house through the back door, returned to the hotel outside the concession, and went back to their rooms to rest in preparation for returning to Shanghai the next day.
You were in a state of confusion. When you were packing your luggage, you realized that the "Prince's" English "Formal Sword" was forgotten at the Baron's house - this was all because you had heard [Wang Zimo] before and thought of the "beloved woman" he said. I was upset and lost my mind while packing my things.
You return to the door of the Baron's house and ask the servant to help you take out the props. Just when you turned to leave, you were stopped - you turned around and saw that the person who stopped you was [Wang Zimo]. He looked at the "formal sword" prop in your hand and recognized you as the "Prince" who performed at the reception. "He came over to say hello. You could only hold back the anger in your heart and asked him what happened?
[Wang Zimo] was completely unaware of your hatred and asked where you and [Hei Li] live? You didn’t tell him, but [Wang Zimo] thought you didn’t tell him because you didn’t know him, so he explained to you that his wife’s name was [Ruan Zhaonan], and she used to be an actress in the “Traveler Bird Theater” with the stage name “White Bird”. ", once performed "Swan Lake" with [Hei Li] on the same stage, he went to see the premiere, it was very exciting - he and his wife met at that time... [Wang Zimo] The more he talks , the more you want to kill him!
So you agreed to take [Wang Zimo] to the hostel, and then took him to a secluded road behind "Yue Wang Hostel". Now you have to go back to get it... You said in your heart that it was too late, so you turned around at [Wang Zimo] After turning over, hit him in the back of the head with the guard part of the "formal sword" - [Wang Zimo] After falling to the ground, you hit his head repeatedly until the "formal sword" was broken... ·
You leaned down, confirmed that [Wang Zimo] was dead, pretended that he had been robbed, and took all the money from the body. You counted nearly thirty silver dollars... and then ran back to the hostel. , hiding the murder weapon broken in two in his luggage.


The next day (August 13), at 9:00 am, you and [Hei Li] paid off the rent, then took the "Shanghai-Nanjing Line" train (6154 times) departing from Nanjing at 8:00, and returned to Shanghai - you Worried that the murder would be exposed, he did not take out the items from his luggage when he returned to his residence. He was ready to flee at any time and told his adoptive father that he had left his "formal sword" at the baron's house.
Fortunately, everything went well after that. After being nervous for a week, you gradually relaxed. Because you had already lied, you didn’t take out the broken sword again... You kept thinking about [Zhaonan] who lost her husband, and even I fantasize about reconnecting with her...
A month later (September 19th), my adoptive father saw the news of [Wang Zimo]'s death in the newspaper and wanted to go to Zhenjiang to express his condolences, but he couldn't get away because of things in the theater troupe. Just when you wanted to go to see [Zhaonan] alone, let him My adoptive father stayed and I went to represent the troupe. The adoptive father thought for a while and then agreed - you should have never gone to Zhenjiang again after the murder, but you wanted to go again because you missed [Zhaonan]!
Yesterday (September 20), at 10:00 a.m., you took the "Shanghai News" newspaper in which your adoptive father had read the news of his death, rushed to the train station, bought a cheap third-class ticket with your change, and got on the train to Zhenjiang. Train (trip 3809) arrived in Zhenjiang again after nearly 9 hours - you didn’t dare to go to the “Yue Wang Hotel” outside the “British Concession” anymore, so you came to the small town by the “Jinghu Lake” and wanted to rent a house here temporarily.
You met [Luo Younuo] by the lake. As his father-killing enemy, you always wanted to avoid the brother and sister, but he still saw him - [Luo Younuo] took the initiative to greet you and joked when he saw that you were carrying your luggage. I asked you if you are going to rent a house in "Ruan's House"? You can only lie and say that you came to Zhenjiang for a business trip, you didn't rent a hotel, and you wanted to find a house to rent here for a few days.
[Luo Younuo] said that only "Ruan's House" can rent houses here, but they are all rented out. It's getting late now. If you don't mind, you can go to his house. It's hard for you to refuse this kind offer, so just apologize and say you're bothering him and you'll pay his rent.
[Luo Younuo] took you to his residence by the lake. When you entered the house, you saw that it was not big but it was very clean, so you asked [Luo Younuo] if he was married? [Luo Younuo] smiled and said: Soon, it will be soon. Then he moved some space in the house for you to put your luggage, and gave you the key to the door lock.
In the evening, you had dinner with [Luo Younuo] and drank some wine, and then fell asleep with [Luo Younuo] on a big bed joined together.
Today (September 21), in the early morning, [Luo Younuo] went out with an oil lamp. You got up immediately, took out the broken "formal sword" from your luggage, went out and threw it into the lake, then locked the door and went out, heading to " "British Concession", and saw that there was a poster on the wall outside the concession looking for clues to the murderer of [Wang Zimo] - you pretended not to know anything, asked others, and learned that the murder was indeed treated as robbery and murder. .
You don't understand English. After entering the concession, you can only ask the Chinese people inside. It took a lot of time to find [Wang Zimo]'s residence. You see that the door is locked and there is a notice for sale of property on it. You step forward. I knocked on the door but no one answered. I asked the Chinese people around me again and learned that [Wang Zimo]'s "widow" no longer wanted to live in the concession and wanted to sell the house after her husband died.
You asked about the whereabouts of the "widow" again, and the other person was a little suspicious seeing that you were a stranger. You immediately explained that you were friends with this family and gave [Zhaonan]'s name.
Only then did the other party believe you and tell you that [Wang Zimo]'s "widow" left the "British Concession" with her luggage the day before yesterday (September 19), and she should have gone back to her parents' home.
The other party then remembered something, saying that the woman had a bad relationship with her mother. Her servant said that her mother had come to the "Wang Family" to threaten her... You listened and wrote it down on paper. I came down, thanked him, and walked out of the "British Concession". I found that it was getting late, so I wanted to wait until tomorrow to see [Zhaonan] at the "Ruan House".
At about 20:00, you returned to [Luo Younuo]’s house, but you didn’t see him.
You originally planned to come back for dinner, but [Luo Younuo] was not at home at this time, and it was inconvenient for you to cook by yourself, so you put the "notes" you took under your pillow, locked the door and went out, along the lakeshore, to find a restaurant in the small town. Still buying something to eat at a business place...
After you finished eating, you still walked back to "Luo's House" along the lakeshore. You saw a fishing boat in the reeds by the lake, with an oil lamp on it and a figure on it.
You look through the moonlight and see that the figure is lying in the boat - you take a few steps closer and see the face of the figure clearly through the light of the oil lamp - she is actually [Zhaonan]!
You were so excited that you immediately ran to the side of the boat and found [Zhaonan] wearing a black dress lying motionless in the fishing boat. You shouted her name, but she didn’t respond... You suddenly panicked and raised your hand. Putting it on [Zhaonan]'s thin face, you can no longer feel the body temperature. You tremblingly reach out to test her breath, and find that she is no longer breathing... Your heart seems to be broken, and you are so painful that you can't speak. , I didn’t even realize that my legs were already standing in the water because I was in a hurry to run to the boat...
You force yourself to calm down and remember that when you met [Luo Younuo] yesterday, he was on this boat - that oil lamp was also brought out by [Luo Younuo] this morning! There is also a hat with a black veil and an empty medicine bottle in the fishing boat - you pick up the medicine bottle and see the words "Tzu Chi Anshen" printed on the back... You can't believe that [Zhaonan] committed suicide by taking medicine. , took the medicine bottle and determined to find out the truth.
You are not related to [Zhaonan] at this time, so you have to run to "Ruan's house" to inform [Zhaonan]'s family.
At about 21:00, you ran into "Ruan's House" and saw [Luo Younuo] standing on the stairs, as if he had just come down - you immediately stopped him and asked him why he came here? [Luo Younuo] smelled of alcohol and was hesitating, so you pulled him upstairs - the floor around the stairs on the second floor is very old, and it makes noise when you walk up - you used to live downstairs, and you only remember [Zhaonan] My relatives all lived upstairs, so I knocked on the door one by one and called everyone out. [Guilang] and [Hei Li] came out of the "young master's room" together, [Xue Yan] came out of the "guest room one", and [Wangdi] came out of the "sister's room".
You pulled [Luo Younuo] and said anxiously to everyone: "Zhaonan is dead!" After hearing this, [Hei Li] hurried to your side and told you in a low voice: "Ms. Ruan is also dead, I'm afraid Zhaonan It's suicide..."
