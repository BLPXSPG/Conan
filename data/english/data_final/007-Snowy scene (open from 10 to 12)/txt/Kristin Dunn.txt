Kristin Dunn
You just met Max Pike tomorrow. As a result, when the reconnaissance meeting was placed, he was trapped in the mountains. You were fortunate to pick up a life and found the cabin in time. As a result, you guess who is inside, it is Max, Coincidental.
You live in Switzerland and study law, but the cost of life is very high. You can only do some private jobs for Max. In most cases, you only need to deposit the money to the designated bank account.You are sure that the money is unknown, otherwise why is it so mysterious.Max asked you to meet with the border between France and Switzerland, and then you two exchanged ski jackets, the money was sewn in the lining of the Max coat, and then you ski returned to Switzerland, and the money was stored in the account.Provide card numbers, the border control between Farui is not strict.
Given that this is a risky business, you plan to raise commissions.Tonight you need to tell Max that you decide to charge more fees for your service, because you find that someone has stared at you (in fact, you just find an excuse).Max currently gives you 5%commission each business, you plan to add to 10%.
other people:
Max Pike: You have known him for almost two years, making a lot of money from his money laundering business.You want to ask for a better price for yourself, but you can't mess up the current cooperative relationship.
Joe Robertson: You heard from Max that he found a partner named Qiao, but you haven't seen him yet. Qiao seems to look at you in a strange way.
