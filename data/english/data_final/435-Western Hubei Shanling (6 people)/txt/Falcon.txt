story background
September 16, 1914 (the third year of the Republic of China)
As early as the late Qing Dynasty, someone proposed to build a "Sichuan-Hankou Railway" connecting Hubei and Sichuan provinces and running through the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River. After that, private funds were raised to establish a railway company to conduct surveys along the route in Hubei.
In the second year of Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty (1910), a professor came to "Jilingping" in western Hubei to inspect the landforms. The manager there was the owner of the "Bakang Village" who owned a large area of ​​land and the "Mountain Spirit" who had been worshiping the "Mountain Spirit" for generations. The "Wizard" who controls life and death.
In June of the third year of the Republic of China (1914), after Zhan Tianyou served as the "Han-Yue-Sichuan Railway Supervisor" of the Ministry of Transportation of the Beiyang Government, he formed a survey team and separately conducted a re-survey of the section from Hubei to Sichuan. In August, a young expert and his assistant came to "Jilingping" for investigation. I don't know what the result will be this time...
your story
Your surname is "Ba" and your name is [Falcon]. You were born in the 21st year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty (1895). Your zodiac sign is Sheep and you are from Hubei and western Hubei. Your father [Ba Mansion Mountain] is the owner of "Bakang Village" and a big landowner of "Jilingping". He owns all the land in "Houya". In addition to farming and harvesting, he also invites merchants to his home every year to do business. The income is very abundant. Your mother [Miao Shi] is the sister of the "Wizard" [Miao Na] in the village - your uncle [Miao Na] was helpful and well-respected during his lifetime. It is said that as a "Wizard", he only cast an unbreakable "death curse" once in his life. ".
After [Miao Na] passed away, his only apprentice [Gui Yin] put on a black robe and became the new "Wizard" of "Bakang Village" - at that time [Gui Yin] took his sister to live in the "Wizard's House" (near the river) Hanging "diaojiaolou", while taking care of [Miao Na]'s daughter [Ruya] (cousin who is 3 years older than you).
There is a sister [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] who is 2 years older than you in your family. She and your mother both want you to study. Later, the village asked your husband to open a private school, and your cousin [Ruya] also found a sister who is 1 year older than you. [Li Gaobai] was your reading companion, and he repeatedly told you not to bully him - you were not interested in studying, so you gave [Li Gaobai] your books, paper and pen, and asked him to help you with your homework until you completed your studies. Your father has always had a good relationship with [Gui Yin]. He later accepted the betrothal gift from [Gui Yin] and agreed to marry [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)], who is 9 years younger than [Gui Yin], to marry him.
In the sixth month of the lunar calendar when you were 16 years old (1910), your sister [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] celebrated her 18th birthday, and the whole village was preparing for her marriage. At that time, there was a man from the provincial capital [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] who came from the provincial capital. Professor Zhou, he took his daughter to send an "Intern" to the village to seek medical treatment, but your father stayed in the "Ba family" and asked [Gui Yin] to prescribe medicine, so you got to know [Professor Zhou]'s daughter [Chen Sha].
[Professor Zhou] is surveying the railway laying route in "Jilingping". Your father is afraid that his family's land interests will be damaged by the construction of the railway. He hopes to arrange the railway to the south bank of the "Ying River" (without passing through "Houya"). You need to find When someone takes [Professor Zhou] there, you recommend [Li Gaobai] - your father then hired [Li Gaobai] as a "Guide" and took [Professor Zhou] to Nan'an for inspection, while [Chen Sha] stayed in the "Ba family" ”, taking care of “Intern”.
[Chen Sha] is a unique girl. She is the same age as you. She has traveled to many places with [Professor Zhou], often climbing mountains and wading in rivers - and you have loved hunting since childhood, swimming and climbing mountains and ridges.
Your mother gave you a string of "bells" to keep with you - although you thought it would affect hunting, you still listened to your mother's words, and later found out that they could be used as musical instruments to accompany folk songs.
While recuperating in "Intern", you took [Chen Sha] to the highest hill of "Jilingping" and looked at the sea of ​​​​red flowers in "Xiya" - if you like [Chen Sha], just ring the "bell" "The accompaniment sang to her: "Little girl, listen to me ask (eh), who is the good hunter on the terrace (eh)? I sing folk songs and you come with me (eh), my brother is handsome and a good hunter (eh)... .” You hoped [Chen Sha] would sing back, but she just nodded.
On the second day of the seventh lunar month, [Professor Zhou] completed the inspection of "Nan'an" and took the recovered "Intern" and [Chen Sha] to leave "Bajia" and return to the "Inn". Your heart suddenly felt empty and you felt nothing. Boring - I don't know what kind of disease your sister had at that time. She often covered her heart and became thinner and thinner. Her mother asked her to go to the "Wizard's House" for medical treatment...
On the 18th day of the seventh lunar month, you saw [Chen Sha] and "Intern" coming to "Bajia" to find your father, so you hid outside the door and overheard your father warning them that there was a dangerous "Mountain" in "Xiya" Spirit", inspection is prohibited!
When you were a child, you heard your uncle talking about "Mountain Spirit" - "Mountain Spirit" and "Wizard" lived a life without fighting against the world. One day, "robbers" broke into the "Mountain Spirit Cave" and tied up "Mountain Spirit" and took him away. , "Mountain Spirit" didn't want to leave, and the "robber" saw that he couldn't take away "Mountain Spirit", so he pulled out a short knife and stabbed him... After "Mountain Spirit" was stabbed, he fell into the river, and the blood flowed out. The flowers on the mountain are all dyed red... (You hated this story when you were a child, so you didn't listen to it. Later you heard Gui Yin tell the rest)... From then on, "Mountain Spirit" began to hate People, those who lured people into "Xiya" died unexpectedly.
You see [Chen Sha] alone - [Chen Sha] quietly tells you that she goes to the "Sister Ling Pagoda" every day... From then on, you go to the "Sister Ling Pagoda" every morning under the pretext of hunting and meet the people who have been waiting for you. Meet at [Chen Sha] inside and spend a short quality time. In the afternoon, you take her back to the "inn".
After that, [Professor Zhou] came to "Bajia" several times to beg for help, but was rejected every time. Your father even asked [Li Gaobai] to notify the farm laborers to stop [Professor Zhou] from breaking in from "Dongya" side.
On the twenty-seventh day of the seventh lunar month, as usual, you took your bow and arrows and ropes to the "Jiling Pagoda". Unexpectedly, before you even got to the foot of the tower, you saw [Chen Sha] running out of the tower in panic. An Adult Man was there. She chased after them - you saw them running towards "Xiya", so you immediately chased them.
After you crossed the "wooden bridge", you saw a man catching up with [Chen Sha] in the nearby woods. He was grabbing her shoulders and trying to strangle her... You rushed over and strangled her from behind. You put all your strength on the man's neck and didn't let go until the man stopped struggling. Then the man fell to the ground and was strangled to death by you!
You were panicked after killing someone and asked [Chen Sha] to go back first. After that, when you see that this is "Xiya" and think of "Mountain Spirit", you use the "rope" (with brown marks on it) used to tie the prey when hunting to make a noose, put the head of the deceased through the noose, and then move a piece Step on the rocks and hang the body from the tree. After pretending to be a suicide, you run home the way you came and hide in the house.
Later that day, your father came back with [Gui Yin], and they found you and asked if you were the one who hanged the man. You saw [Gui Yin] holding the "rope" you left with brown marks (the blood stains soaked in after tying the prey that was slaughtered on the spot, which turned brown after a while), and you admitted it, but you didn't mention it. [Chen Sha], only said that he was fighting with the other party and accidentally killed him.
Your father scolded you, and your future brother-in-law [Gui Yin] took away the "rope" and said he would find a way for you... After that, it was rumored that the man fell asleep after seeing the "Mountain Spirit" The devil commits suicide.
On the 28th day of the seventh lunar month, my sister's friend "Li Wa" sent her an "embroidered wedding dress". While she was crying (there is a custom of crying in marriage in the village), she gave you a wedding dress she had carried with her since she was a child. "Red Leather Scabbard", as a souvenir of separation from you before getting married. You saw that the scabbard was exquisitely made, but it couldn't hold the hunting knife. You didn't want it, so your sister whispered that you could give it to the girl you like... You suddenly realized it and took the "red leather scabbard" to "Sister Mausoleum". "Tower", I waited until dusk and still didn't see [Chen Sha].
On the 29th day of the seventh lunar month, you didn't see your sister. I heard that she went out early in the morning. Then [Gui Yin] came to "Bajia" to find your father, and you heard them talking about someone going to "Mountain Spirit Cave" to steal something... Then your father went out with [Gui Yin] and said I want to go to the "old wooden house" to express my condolences to the relatives of the deceased the day before yesterday.
You originally planned to go to "Jiling Pagoda" as usual, but you were afraid of meeting your father and others on the way, so you wanted to wait for them to come back before setting off. Then [Chen Sha] came to "Bajia" and you came out to see her immediately.
【Chen Sha】After meeting you, she first asked where the "Wizard" went. You told her that the "Wizard" went to the "Old Wooden House" with your father... You didn't have time to take out the "red leather knife" "Sheath", [Chen Sha] suddenly hugged you and asked you if "Mountain Spirit" would harm her father?
You were startled and didn't answer - your family, whether it's your mother, sister or you, all believe in "Mountain Spirit". You also know that "Mountain Spirit" has taboos (such as murder and arson, adultery between men and women, and stealing from gods or dead people). All things are taboo, and those who violate taboos must sacrifice their lives to be forgiven. The "Wizard" in the past generations has always been supervising "Sister Ping" on behalf of "Mountain Spirit"... This is the name of "Sister Ping" Rules are more important than royal laws in everyone's mind - thinking of this makes you scared.
At this time, your mother came out to ask about the situation. [Chen Sha] then revealed that her father had disappeared early in the morning. She found someone in the "Mountain Spirit Cave" - ​​her father was sitting in the cave, holding a sharp " Dagger", as if lost in thought, kept muttering to himself: "Mountain Spirit... I, Zhou Yuntang, finally saw you... I will never forget you..." After that, no matter what [Chen Sha] How to call, her father just raised his head without any other response, as if he was possessed... When your mother heard this, she trembled all over and said with a pale face: "This is indeed the Mountain Spirit... ....You guys bring him back quickly, I have a way to save him!"
You should accompany [Chen Sha] out immediately and take her around the "cemetery" to "Xiya" (according to custom, passing through the "cemetery" is unlucky, and usually you take a detour between the two mountains to the north of the "cemetery") , walked into the "Mountain Spirit Cave" and found that there was no one inside! You let [Chen Sha] stay and walked out of the cave. You saw a figure in the east and walked over there. When you were about to reach the "wooden bridge", you saw your sister [Juan] wearing a red "embroidered wedding dress". [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] Lying on the ground with your "dagger" stuck in his heart, he is dead!
My sister closed her eyes and held the handle of the knife with both hands. Her posture was like committing suicide... You picked up your sister and felt that her body was not stiff and there was warmth. You thought of your mother saying when you were a child, "Mountain Spirit Cave" "There is a precious "resurrection incense" in it. Do you remember that your uncle used it to resurrect the dead!
You chanted the "soul-returning incense", carried your sister back to the "Mountain Spirit Cave", pulled out the "dagger" inserted into her heart (your dagger is different from the dagger and is larger in size), and saw that there was not much blood.
You endured the unpleasant smell in the cave and kept rummaging around - you saw a "thin board coffin" and many "medicine bags" in the depths, and finally found a cupboard with "Returning Incense" written on the outside. box, immediately pour out all the incense inside, and light it next to my sister's body. When I see the smoke surrounding my sister, I realize that I don't know what to do with the rest, so I can only run out of the hole to find someone - you realize 【Chen Sha】is not in the cave.
At this time, you couldn't care about anything else. You followed the way you came, bypassing the "cemetery" and ran back to "Bakang Village". When you went home, you asked your mother how to use the "Returning Incense" to take effect. You accidentally said that your sister had already suicide. After my mother heard this, she immediately collapsed to the ground, muttering: "This is Mountain Spirit's punishment... Mountain Spirit will not forgive us..." You are so anxious, see your mother like this You couldn't help, so you ran out again, but you met your father when he came back. He told you that [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] had committed suicide, and the body had been sent to the "cemetery", and now he asked his subordinates to help [Professor Zhou] Collecting the body - It turns out that just now, your father and [Gui Yin] saw [Chen Sha]’s father’s body!
Your mind was completely confused at this time, and you ran into the "cemetery" and saw a "thin board coffin" in the "Bajia" cemetery. [Gui Yin] was nailing coffin nails on the coffin lid... Your wish for your sister to come back to life is now shattered!
【Gui Yin】Let you go back in despair. After you walked out of the "cemetery", you didn't go home. Instead, you went to the "Inn" to find [Chen Sha] - [Chen Sha] had been crying. You stayed with her silently until dark before leaving. Before leaving, you pressed your sister's hand As she said during her lifetime, she gave the "red leather scabbard" she gave you to [Chen Sha].
When you returned home, you saw your mother standing in the yard, looking sad and with tears on her face. When she saw you, she hugged you tightly as if to say goodbye. At this time, you had accepted the fact that your sister was dead, but you couldn't say it. To comfort my mother, I could only lower my head and go back to the house.
After a long time, a servant came in and said that he saw your mother walking out of the west gate of "Bakang Village" alone and disappeared without a trace. After her father heard about it, he asked you to take people to find her quickly! It was already late at night. You asked someone to light a torch and went out through the west gate of the village. You guessed that your mother might go to the "cemetery" to see your sister's body, so you took someone there first.
You met [Li Gaobai] and an older [Youth] guarding a coffin at the east entrance of the "cemetery", and asked them if they had seen anyone passing by just now? 【Youth】Immediately answer no. You know that after coming out of the west gate of the village, if you go north, you will pass by the east entrance of the "cemetery" - you heard [Youth] say that no one was passing by, so he ordered everyone to go south and look for it!
Until the next day (the 30th day of the seventh lunar month), when it was almost dawn, you still found nothing and could only return to "Bakang Village" exhausted. At this time, a farmhand who got up early to work in "Dongya" came to report that he saw a female corpse under the "Wooden Bridge"! You led people to run to identify her, and saw her mother who had drowned. At this moment, you finally couldn't help but burst into tears...
[Gui Yin] was then called to help. Because your mother had no other injuries on her body, her clothes were intact, and her death condition was indeed drowning, everyone could only guess that she committed suicide by drowning...Father took you to " "Cemetery" to bury your sister. You saw your cousin [Ruya] also coming. In addition, there was also the "Intern" who had lived in your house, but you didn't see [Chen Sha] - [Chen Sha] didn't even come to say goodbye to you. , he and "Intern" took the body of [Professor Zhou] and left "Sister Lingping".
A week later, your mother was also buried in the "Bajia" cemetery - this series of accidents happened one after another, leaving you no time to think - the death of your sister and mother made you extremely sad, and the departure of [Chen Sha] made you sad. Make you miss me more than ever.
The next year (1911), your father arranged for cousin [Ruya] to marry [Gui Yin].
This year (1914), in August, an "expert" came to "Jilingping" for inspection and visited your father. You recognized him as the "Intern" who was with [Professor Zhou] back then, and you immediately thought of [Chen Sha], But at this time, your father has arranged for you to get engaged to [Gui Yin]’s sister [Gan Ma] and sent you a betrothal gift.
Your father still hopes that "experts" will go to the south bank of the "Eagle River" to investigate, and he also said that he would find a guide for him.
After that, you went to the "Inn" several times, trying to find an "expert" to inquire about [Chen Sha], but you didn't meet anyone. I heard that he took his "assistant" to the north for inspection.
Yesterday (September 15th), a fire broke out in "Xiya" and was put out by [Gui Yin]. You went to the "Inn" again in the afternoon and saw your former reading companion [Li Gaobai]. You were so happy that you took him to the pub in the "Inn" to reminisce... You drank and chatted, and the more you talked, the more you talked. They left drunkenly late at night.
Today (September 16th), you woke up at home and couldn’t remember what you said yesterday when you were drunk. You only vaguely remembered hearing someone mention your deceased sister... Then you listened to the voice at home. The servant said that yesterday (September 15th), a woman who did not dress like the villagers came to see you. After that, she was taken to the east side of the "Wizard's House" by a woman wearing a "mask" - you want to come to you The woman in question may be [Chen Sha], so regardless of the hangover headache, he immediately went out to find her.
You met the "expert" (Zheng Hanzhen) and [Li Gaobai] in the village. Before you said hello, you saw your cousin [Ruya] carrying a "basket" and a woman wearing a "mask" (Gan Ma) stopped you. She - Beside the woman wearing the "mask", there is a figure you have never forgotten, it is [Chen Sha]!

The story after the pleasantries
Everyone accepted your invitation and came to dine in the "hall" of "Bajia". There was home-brewed "rice wine" at the table - [Gan Ma] never took off his "mask" and never ate or drank - you My father was not at home at the time, and I heard someone said that he and "Wizard" [Gui Yin] had gone out early in the morning.
After finishing the meal, the servants cleared the table and served tea. At this time, you heard your father and [Gui Yin] talking while returning to the "Ba family". They continued to talk outside the "hall" door - you listened vaguely. Your father asked: "Who is...?" [Gui Yin] said: "I guess... this person was there back then..." Your father said again: "If So, I will go to the "old wooden house"..." [Gui Yin] lowered his voice: "...the one closest to the river..." your father said harshly : "If it's true... I can't forgive you..." [Gui Yin] said: "I'll go back and use the "spiritual divination" to confirm... and then bring the incense... ....”
You want to tell your father that you have guests, just open the door and come out. Your father and [Gui Yin] immediately stopped talking - you saw that both of them were dirty... [Gui Yin] said goodbye to your father, [Ruya] So he took [Gan Ma] and [Gui Yin] home, and [Gan Ma] also pulled [Chen Sha] and left together.
[Zheng Hanzhen] also came out to see your father. Your father looked bad and said he had to wash up first and would go out soon. He asked you to accompany [Zheng Hanzhen] and wait until he comes back in the afternoon to receive him well.
You and [Zheng Hanzhen] returned to the "lobby". After chatting for a few words, [Li Gaobai] suddenly said that he had a place to go, and then left in a hurry. You glanced at the Western clock in the "lobby", which was pointing to the afternoon. 1 o'clock (13:00) - You finally reunited with [Chen Sha], but you didn't even have a chance to be alone, and you didn't want to stay with [Zheng Hanzhen] in the "Ba family", so you said you wanted to meet someone, and then Get out of the house.
You want to see [Chen Sha], but she lives in the "Wizard's house"! You clearly know that you are engaged to [Gui Yin]’s sister [Gan Ma], but you cannot let the “Wizard” family see you and [Chen Sha] together under any circumstances! But you can't help but miss it, so you want to go outside the village, on the edge of the "Tiger River" on the other side of the "Wizard's House", hoping to see [Chen Sha] across the river.
You walk quickly to the east gate of the village and see a small boat tied to the river west of the "Stone Bridge". Lying on it is a black and thin [Youth], who looks like a farmhand (your family is the only one on the terrace). There are farm laborers).
You immediately thought of a good idea and went over to tell [Youth] that you wanted to use the boat. [Youth] said that he would use it in the afternoon. You said you would return it to him soon, but [Youth] still refused, so you glared and asked him what he wanted to do with the boat. [Youth] seemed to be afraid of you, so he ran ashore and said you should use it first.
You row the boat to the north of the "Wizard's House", tie the bow to the west to the west pillar on the north side of the east house, and let the hull face the window of the east house (Chen Sha lives here temporarily). You stand on the boat, take off one of the "bells" on your body, throw it into the open window on the second floor of the east side room, and then call [Chen Sha] softly.
[Chen Sha] Then he poked his head out of the second floor window and saw you.
At this time, you vaguely heard someone arguing with [Gui Yin] on the "terrace" on the second floor of the "Wizard's House" main house. They mentioned the "returning incense". [Gui Yin] refused and got angry. Then there was Something fell... But at the moment you only have [Chen Sha] in your eyes. You kept waving to her to come out, but she retracted her head.
After a while, [Chen Sha] climbed out of the first-floor window of the east house and jumped onto the boat - you immediately hugged her, unable to control your emotions, but the boat under your feet obviously couldn't help being so turbulent that it started to sway under the force. ·····
You and [Chen Sha] couldn't stand still for a moment and fell into the river from the boat. You were afraid that the people from the "Wizard Family" would see you, so you dived into the water and swam hard in the direction of the "Jiling Tower" along the current... ····When you swam far away, you surfaced for air and saw [Chen Sha] swimming next to you, giving you a long-lost smile.
You were overjoyed and swam forward with [Yi Sha] - you and [Chen Sha] were like two happy fish, playing in the blue waves of the "Tiger River" - you quickly swam past the "Sisters Tower" , [Chen Sha] went to the river bank on the "Dongya" side, you dived under the water, and when [Chen Sha] was looking for you anxiously, you suddenly emerged from the river, startling her.
You laughed, but [Chen Sha] didn’t seem happy, her eyes only stared at the grove on the other side...
You climbed onto the shore, held [Chen Sha] in your arms and told jokes, but [Chen Sha] still didn't laugh, and said she was wet now, how could she go back to see people? You said not to worry, you would go home immediately and bring her some clean clothes - [Chen Sha] urged you to go back quickly, and you ran home along the river bank. You meet a few farmhands on the road, and you think that they have to work in the fields of "Dongya" at 2 o'clock in the afternoon (14:00) every day. It should be almost time now.
You continue to run home, and just after passing the "old wooden house", you see your father and several servants coming from the opposite side from a distance. You are afraid that your father will ask you why you are like a drowned rat, so you turn around and prepare to Go home in a circle (from "Xiya" to "Bakang Village") - You run back to the place where you just landed, but you don't see [Chen Sha], so you continue to run forward across the "wooden bridge".
You run to the west of the "Wooden Bridge" and see "rice wine" and "oil cake" on the ground near the shore, as if you are worshiping the dead. You stop to take a breath, thinking that today is the 27th day of the seventh lunar month. The day after tomorrow is the anniversary of the death of your mother and sister. At this time, you see that the original sea of ​​​​red flowers in "Xiya" has turned into scorched earth, and you suddenly remember that yesterday (September 15th) when you came home drunk, you met the old servant "Wang" Uncle", he said he saw your sister! You were drunk at the time and scolded him for talking nonsense and being dim-sighted. "Wangbo" immediately took a sip and said that after the fire was extinguished, he stayed on the hill of "Dongya" and later saw "Miss Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)" and "Miss Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)" The "embroidered wedding dress" she wore was the one she wore on the day she died. It was also made by "Li Wa", the daughter of "Wang Bo", and it was absolutely unmistakable!
You immediately asked "Wang Bo" if he could see his face clearly and where he had gone? "Wangbo" said that "Miss Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)" had blood on her face and a bloody "dagger" in her hand. She covered her heart and walked across the "wooden bridge" to the "West "Ya"-"Wangbo" is afraid of "Mountain Spirit" and dare not follow...
Thinking of these things now, you feel dubious, so you run south into the "cemetery" and find your sister's grave. You see that the soil on it has been turned over again, and there are two "shovels" thrown next to it (with the words " Bajia" mark)! At this time, you see [Zheng Hanzhen] also coming to the grave from the opposite side - if you want to verify "Wang Bo", throw a "shovel" to [Zheng Hanzhen] and ask you to help him dig the grave and say your My sister may not be dead!
You quickly dug out a "thin board coffin", threw down the "shovel", and worked together to lift the coffin up from the excavated soil - the lid of the coffin was not nailed, just covered!
You and [Zheng Hanzhen] opened the coffin lid together and saw a partially decomposed male corpse inside, with a vague face - definitely not your sister! At this time, you heard an exclamation and noticed that there were other people in the "cemetery". [Li Gaobai] was standing on the east side, and on the west side were [Ruya] and [Gan Ma] who was wearing a "mask" and had wet clothes. 】.
[Chen Sha], who was soaked all over, ran into the "cemetery" from the west side. Panting heavily, she approached the coffin, saw the corpse inside, and shouted with a trembling voice: "The people inside... ..It’s Li Demu!”
You are shocked and don’t know why the others are here...

next story
At about 16:30, everyone returned to "Bakang Village" and saw "Grandma" playing with her grandson on the roadside. She sang a song belonging to "Ghost Moon" (the seventh month of the lunar calendar). : "Don't go into the water before and after the Zhongyuan Dynasty (yo), if you drown, you will find a scapegoat (yo); don't sleep under a tree in July (yo), if you hang yourself, you will find a scapegoat (yo)..."
Although you are under the sun, you can't help but shiver - the clothes you were wearing were all wet before, and because of the dirt from digging the grave, they all turned into mud. You saw that [Zheng Hanzhen] who helped you dig the grave also soiled his clothes, so he took him back to "Bajia" to take a shower and change clothes.
After the servants boil the water, you first go to the wooden bathtub to take a bath, then change into clean clothes and come out, then ask the servants to clean the wooden bathtub and boil the water again, change into [Zheng Hanzhen] and go in to wash.
After you left a set of your clean clothes for [Zheng Hanzhen], you went out to the "Wizard's house" - you remember the day your sister committed suicide, after you left the "cemetery", [Gui Yin] stayed to pray, The "sheet coffin" had not yet been laid in the ground - so you conclude he must have known something!
At about 17:00, you walked into the main house of the "Wizard's House", went straight to the second floor, pushed the door of the "Quiet Room", and found that the door latch was inserted inside. You knocked hard, and when there was no response, you grabbed the door handle. Shake it, shout [Gui Yin], and ask loudly if the "soul-returning incense" has taken effect?
There was no response in the "quiet room". [Ruya] came over and stopped you. She said that her husband could not be disturbed in there and asked you to come back later. You can only listen to your cousin, follow her and leave, and when you go downstairs, ask her if [Chen Sha] is back (when you saw Chen Sha today, you always felt that there was a trace of your sister in her)? My cousin said that [Chen Sha] did not return to the "Wizard's house" and did not know where he went.
You return to "Bajia" and see [Zheng Hanzhen] who has taken a shower and put on clean clothes. When he sees you, he asks where your father is. He has something to discuss with your father about the railway line - You said you don't know either. At this time, because your sister's body was missing, you were half-shocked and half-joyed, and began to believe that she was still alive - but why was the body in the coffin the person you killed? You couldn't think of an answer, so you said you wanted to go to the "Wizard's house", and [Zheng Hanzhen] said he wanted to go with you.
You called a few servants to follow you and went out with [Zheng Hanzhen]. Before you reached the "Wizard's house", you saw your cousin [Ruya] looking outside the door, and then [Li Gaobai] walked out of the main house. He whispered something to [Ruya].
You met outside the "Wizard's House", and as soon as you asked, "Is Gui Yin out?" you saw [Gan Ma] wearing a "mask" panting and running over from the east gate of the village.
[Gan Ma] ran to the door and shouted: "My brother is in trouble!" Then he ran into the main house of the "Wizard's House" - you followed her into the house and climbed up the stairs on the west side to the second floor together.
[Gan Ma] tried hard to hit the door of the "quiet room", but couldn't open it because of the latch inside.
You held [Gan Ma], let several servants bump into it, and finally broke the door open - there was no one in the "quiet room", and there were some things scattered on the ground - [Gan Ma] ran to the "terrace" first, and you followed She saw a "rope" tied to the east railing of the "terrace". It seemed like something was hanging outside... You recognized the "rope" with brown marks on it. It was you. It was originally used to fake hanging! You felt scared, [Gan Ma] almost fell down, so you hugged her subconsciously - although you still couldn't see [Gan Ma]'s expression behind the "mask", you could clearly feel that both she and you were trembling. .
At this time, [Chen Sha], who had changed into clean clothes, also appeared on the "terrace".
[Li Gaobai] ran to the "railing", looked down, and shouted: "It's Gui Yin!"
[Ruya] shouted in shock: "Pull him up quickly!"
[Zheng Hanzhen] immediately went over and worked with [Li Gaobai] to pull up the "rope" and pulled the body with the "rope" tightly around the neck out of the "terrace" and placed it flat on the "terrace" - the deceased It’s [Gui Yin]!
The sun has not set yet, but you suddenly feel a chill... Maybe [Gui Yin] is not the only one who died today...
