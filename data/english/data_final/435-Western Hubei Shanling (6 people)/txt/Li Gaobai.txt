story background
September 16, 1914 (the third year of the Republic of China)
As early as the late Qing Dynasty, someone proposed to build a "Sichuan-Hankou Railway" connecting Hubei and Sichuan provinces and running through the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River. After that, private funds were raised to establish a railway company to conduct surveys along the route in Hubei.
In the second year of Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty (1910), a professor came to "Jilingping" in western Hubei to inspect the landforms. The manager there was the owner of the "Bakang Village" who owned a large area of ​​land and the "Mountain Spirit" who had been worshiping the "Mountain Spirit" for generations. The "Wizard" who controls life and death.
In June of the third year of the Republic of China (1914), after Zhan Tianyou served as the "Han-Yue-Sichuan Railway Supervisor" of the Ministry of Transportation of the Beiyang Government, he formed a survey team and separately conducted a re-survey of the section from Hubei to Sichuan. In August, a young expert and his assistant came to "Jilingping" for inspection. I don't know what the result will be this time...
your story
Your name is [Li Gaobai], you were born in the 20th year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty (1894), your zodiac sign is Horse, and you are from Hefeng, Hubei.
When you were 11 years old (1904), your father died and your mother (Qian) was widowed in your hometown. Your eldest brother [Li Demu] (7 years older than you) and second brother [Li Liangsong] (6 years older than you) took you with them. He came to "Jilingping" to make a living and was hired by the big landowner [Ba Mansion Mountain] to cultivate the land of "Dongya".
At that time, a "Man in Black Robe" came to the "old wooden house" where the farm laborers lived (one "dormitory" can accommodate 3 or 4 farm laborers, and you brothers occupied one room). He claimed to be the "Man in Black Robe" from "Bakang Village". Wizard” [Gui Yin], give you some talismans. Coming with [Gui Yin] is a girl [Ruya] who is older than you.
[Ba Mansion Mountain] does not allow farm laborers to go to "Xiya" west of the "Wooden Bridge". [Gui Yin] also warns you that there is a "Mountain Spirit" that hates people and will lure intruders to death... The eldest brother felt that [Gui Yin]'s warning and gift of the amulet were a kind gesture, so he took the local products from his hometown and went to the "Wizard's House" in the village to reciprocate the gift. From then on, [Ruya] often came to your place as a guest.
Your brothers have always wanted you to study, but they have no money. After hearing about it, [Ruya], who is already familiar with your brothers, introduced you to [Ba Mansion Mountain]'s son [Falcon] as a companion, and you can enter "Bakang Village" for free. " private school, and then she recommended that you go to the "Wizard's house" in the village to do chores in your spare time (just a handyman, you are not allowed to touch witchcraft medicine and other items), earn a little money, and help your elder brother share his worries.
[Falcon] is 1 year younger than you, very strong, likes hunting and swimming, and often skips school, but he never bullies you, and even gives you his books, paper, and pens so that you can do his homework for him. [Ruya] always takes care of you in the village. When the weather is bad, he will let you live in the "Wizard's House" (a suspended "stilted building" on the side of the river).
You met [Gui Yin]'s sister [Gan Ma] at "Wizard's house". She is 2 years younger than you and wants to be friends with you - you had heard people in the village say that "Wizard"'s sister is a "living dead" ", I was scared in my heart. Although I agreed, I never dared to approach her - [Gan Ma] sometimes appears suddenly when you are not paying attention, making you even more scared, and you can always smell her fragrance... ··When you work at the "Wizard's house", [Gui Yin] requires you to arrange things neatly according to his habits, and the wages are a little more than being a farmhand.
You cherish the rare opportunity to study very much and study hard. After completing your studies at the private school, you still want to go to school in the provincial capital. Your eldest brother promised to save your tuition.
When you were 17 (in 1910), your eldest brother became absent-minded. When you talked to him, he always seemed not to hear you. Sometimes he would bring "rice wine" and delicious "oil daddy" back. You ask the second brother, and the second brother smiles and says that the eldest brother has someone he likes, so don’t worry (after the second brother told you, he told you not to tell anyone) - There was a big event in the village at that time: [Gui Yin] and [Ba Mansion Mountain]'s daughter set a wedding date and began to prepare for the wedding.
In the sixth month of the lunar calendar this year, the sun is blazing. [Ba Mansion Mountain] hires you to be a "Guide". He will temporarily leave the "Wizard's house" and take a [Professor Zhou] from the provincial capital (Wuhan) to "Yinghe" South Coast Inspection - [Ba Mansion Mountain] specifically states that you can only take him to the South Coast.
[Professor Zhou] knows a lot of folklore of the Chu region. Later you chatted with him about "Mountain Spirit" - you heard [Professor Zhou] say that "Mountain Spirit" and "Scholar" once lived a happy life, but were killed by a greedy man. The "rich man" coveted magical powers, and later the "rich man" used the "Wizard" to try to take away the "Mountain Spirit" from the "scholar"... At the end of the story, "Mountain Spirit" committed suicide, and the "rich man" and the "Wizard" Received due punishment.
[Professor Zhou] saw during the inspection that you were eager to learn and had some talent in geography, so he taught you relevant knowledge and wrote you a "letter of introduction" recommending you to go to the "Chongli Hall" (Higher School) in Wuhan. continue their studies. You tell your two brothers the good news, but the eldest brother can't come up with the money he promised to support your education. You know that your eldest brother has no money, so you don't dare to mention it again.
On the second day of the seventh lunar month, [Professor Zhou] completed his inspection in the South Bank, and your work came to an end. You continued to work at the "Wizard's house", and then you saw [Gui Yin]'s "fiancée" (Daughter of Ba Mansion Mountain) , who is also Falcon's sister, looks slightly similar to Ruya comes to see him almost every day, and then the two go out together. More than half a month later, [Ba Mansion Mountain] asked you to inform your elder brother that [Professor Zhou] cannot be allowed to break into "Xiya" from "Dongya". The eldest brother stopped [Professor Zhou], but he was always listless after returning to the "dormitory". You were worried about the eldest brother, but the second brother was sent to the provincial capital (Wuhan) after the "Hungry Ghost Festival" by the eldest brother, and you could not find anyone to discuss it. [Professor Zhou] found you later, gave you some money, and asked you to help him investigate how to get from "Bakang Village" to "Mountain Spirit Cave" in "Xiya".
On the 22nd day of the seventh lunar month, after finishing your chores at the "Wizard's House", you saw [Gui Yin] waiting for your "fiancee", so you told him that you were going back to the "Old Wooden House", and then walked out of the west gate of "Bakang Village". Went to "Xiya".
You quickly found the "Mountain Spirit Cave" and used the method taught to you by [Professor Zhou] to draw a map from "Bakang Village" - just as you finished drawing, you saw someone coming from the "Mountain Spirit Cave" Come out - you remember [Gui Yin] will go to the "Mountain Spirit Cave" for half a month at the end of summer every year to "retreat", [Gan Ma] sometimes goes to deliver food, but now [Gui Yin] and [Gan Ma] are still " "Bakang Village", there shouldn't be anyone in the cave!
The person you later saw clearly was the eldest brother [Li Demu] who was banned from coming to "Xiya"! The eldest brother kept chanting: "Mountain Spirit...I can't live without you..." He staggered through the red mountain flowers and walked back to "Dongya" without noticing you. You follow your eldest brother across the "Wooden Bridge" and come to the "Jiling Tower". Watch your eldest brother go up the tower, and then follow him in.
As you walk up the tower, you hear the voices of your eldest brother and a "female" coming from above (it's several floors away, so you can't hear the specific content) - it turns out that your eldest brother is here for a date, and you feel a little relieved - what do you think of the opposite sex? The impression is still very hazy. Before, I only had some inexplicable feelings for [Ruya], who was older than you... After that, you returned to the "old wooden house" thoughtfully. When you saw your eldest brother coming back at night, you remembered that you had forgotten. Go to the "Inn"!
The next day, you went to the "Wizard's house" to do things as usual. Because the weather was bad in the next few days, you stayed at the "Wizard's house" and did not go to deliver the "hand-drawn map" to [Professor Zhou].
On the 27th day of the seventh lunar month, you saw [Gui Yin]'s "fiancée" coming to see him, but [Gui Yin] was going to "Ba's house" soon and couldn't go out with her, so you sent her home.
After they left, the second brother came to see you - he said that he did not see the eldest brother after returning to "Jilingping" today. He also heard that the eldest brother did not return last night and saw no one in the fields... 2 Brother whispered that even if the eldest brother went on a date, it would be after finishing farm work... You suddenly had a bad feeling, so you told [Gan Ma] that you wanted to go out for a while, and then took the second brother with you. "Xiya".
You take your second brother to the "Mountain Spirit Cave" and see [Gui Yin] and [Ba Mansion Mountain] looking outside the cave. [Ba Mansion Mountain] gets angry when he sees you, and involuntarily asks [Gui Yin] to send you off. Go back to the "old cabin".
[Gui Yin] took you and your second brother to the east. When you were almost to the west of the "Wooden Bridge", you saw a man hanging in the nearby woods. When you got closer, you saw that it was the eldest brother [Li Demu] - him Hanged from a tree with a stone at his feet! You were so frightened that [Gui Yin] asked you to inform [Ba Mansion Mountain] - You hurried back and saw [Ba Mansion Mountain], and stammered to tell him what happened.
[Ba Mansion Mountain] asks you to go to "Ba Mansion" to ask someone to come. You run back to "Bakang Village" and call the servants of "Ba Family". Together they go back to the corpse and see [Ba Mansion Mountain] is also here. [Gui Yin] said that the person committed suicide... 2 Brother brought a coffin, and everyone put the body down, put it in the coffin, and sent it to the "cemetery." Because you brothers are not from the village, you can only open the coffin lid outside the east entrance of the "cemetery." spirit.
[Ba Mansion Mountain] At this time, he began to scold people, saying that he had warned you long ago that you were not allowed to go to "Xiya", why didn't you listen! The second brother was heartbroken and contradicted [Ba Mansion Mountain] on the spot. He was immediately caught by the people from the "Ba family". After being punched a few times, he and you were sent back to the "old wooden house". The second brother was still aggrieved, so he started packing his luggage and asked someone to inform the "Ba family" that he would take you away from "Sister Lingping" and send the eldest brother's body back to his hometown.
On the 29th day of the seventh lunar month, [Ba Mansion Mountain] and [Gui Yin] came to the "Old Wooden House", both of whom looked very ugly. [Ba Mansion Mountain] paid the second brother the money he and the eldest brother paid for working as farmhands. [Gui Yin] took out a few silver coins and asked you to go to the "Inn" to hire a carriage to pull the body - because the weather is hot, the body cannot be exposed for a long time, so the second brother asked you to put the coffin lid on the eldest brother's coffin.
You go to close the coffin lid outside the east entrance of the "cemetery" and see [Falcon] running into the "cemetery" in a hurry, and then running out again soon (Falcon did not notice you). Then the second brother comes to you and says that he has hired a carriage and will come to pull the coffin early tomorrow morning. When you and your second brother returned to the "Old Wooden House", you passed by the "Bakang Village" and heard from people in the village that the daughter of [Ba Mansion Mountain] committed suicide. "Home" cemetery area, only need to be buried... You and your second brother returned to the "old wooden house" and found that your luggage had been turned over. When you went out to inquire, you and your second brother found out that it was [Ba Mansion Mountain] where you and your second brother After everyone went out, I suspected that you were stealing something, so I rummaged around the house and found nothing before leaving with [Gui Yin], saying that we were going to the "Mountain Spirit Cave"...
Before the second brother could finish listening, he pulled you back into the house and closed the door. He angrily said that the eldest brother died working for the "Ba Family" and [Ba Mansion Mountain] also regarded your brothers as "thieves" - in this case, the money on hand is not enough anyway. I went back to hold a funeral for my eldest brother, so I simply fulfilled my wish at [Ba Mansion Mountain] and became a real "thief" before I left!
The second brother then came up with an extremely bold plan - it turns out that the second brother thought that [Ba Mansion Mountain]'s daughter would definitely put some valuable burial objects in the coffin before she was buried. You go to the "cemetery" at night to steal them and leave early tomorrow morning. , never come back... Although you are scared, you also hate [Ba Mansion Mountain] for bullying others so much, so you listen to your second brother, take your tools and luggage, and go to the east entrance of the "cemetery" together. Pretending to be a wake-up call for my elder brother, I waited for it to get dark.
After dark, no one can be seen in the "cemetery". The second brother and you walked in carefully, and soon you saw a coffin in the "Bajia" cemetery, parked under the cold moonlight - you couldn't help but The hair on your head stood up - the second brother was still bold at this time. He asked you to look behind the nearby grave mound while he came to pry the coffin.
You hid and saw your second brother prying off the "coffin nails" from a distance. The "crunching" sound was particularly harsh in the silent night. You looked around nervously, your heart already in your throat. At this time, dark clouds covered the moon. It was dark, and you were afraid. When there was a little moonlight, you immediately looked in the direction of the coffin, and you could no longer see your second brother.
You didn't sleep well for two days in a row, and your eyelids started to twitch after staring for a while... You tried your best to open your eyes, and suddenly you saw a figure bending down and standing up next to the coffin that was pried open - at this time When the moonlight suddenly appears, you see that the figure is a "naked woman"!
The woman's back is facing you, and the moonlight shines on her skin, which seems to be coated with a layer of ice. She does not look like a stranger. She is holding a sharp object in her hand...The woman then takes out a knife from the coffin. You put on a red coat, then turned your head, your face was covered with blood - you were so frightened that your vision went dark and you didn't know anything anymore... When your second brother woke you up, you trembled and told what you saw. everything. The second brother was so angry that he almost beat you and scolded you for dreaming while you were asleep - he had already covered the coffin and hammered the "coffin nails" back in. Where was the naked woman?
The second brother dragged you back to the east entrance of the "cemetery" and continued to guard the eldest brother's coffin, but you couldn't forget the scene you just saw - was it really a dream? At the age of 17, you have a strange impulse at this time...
Soon, [Falcon] led people holding torches out of the west gate of the village and went to the east entrance of the "cemetery" to ask if you had seen anyone pass by just now? The second brother immediately answered no, and [Falcon] ordered everyone to go south to look for it! You wanted to ask what happened, but the second brother held your head and turned around, telling you to mind your own business.
After that, you and your second brother faced the "cemetery", ignored any movement behind you, and knelt down in front of your eldest brother's coffin until the next day (the 30th day of the seventh lunar month). The carriage arrived after dawn. You and your second brother carried the coffin up, drove through "Bakang Village" and left "Jilingping" - you thought you would never come back.
You and your second brother returned to your hometown to see your mother. You told your eldest brother's story, and the whole family burst into tears. The second brother left you at home while he went out to sell the stolen things, arranged for the elder brother's burial, and then took you to the provincial capital (Wuhan). He used the remaining money and a "letter of introduction" from [Professor Zhou] to give it to you. Entered the "Chongli Hall".
You study harder and put all your energy into your studies. Once you relax, you will think of the "naked woman" you saw that night, which is like a fantasy and a dream, haunting your mind. You try to draw it, but you can't. A clear look.
This year (1914), in July, the second brother came to say goodbye to you, saying that he was going out to make money. You saw that the second brother was now dark and thin, and you hoped that you could make money quickly after graduation to help the family. At this time, the school's "survey" The expert "Zheng Hanzhen" is going to "Jilingping" for inspection and wants to hire an "assistant" to go with him. Because of the difficult conditions, the classmates are not interested. Coming from a poor family, you felt that the salary was not bad, and since you were familiar with "Sister Lingping", you wanted to take the opportunity to show off, so you applied for this job.
In August, you and [Zheng Hanzhen] came to "Jilingping" again and stayed in the "dizi room" of the "Yizhan" hotel. After that, [Zheng Hanzhen] went to "Bakang Village" alone to visit "Ba Family". You took the opportunity to go to "Wizard Family" to meet [Ruya] and [Gui Yin] who had taken care of you, and express your gratitude to them (the more you behave, the more The more you are well-informed and well-spoken, the more surprised they will be and the more proud you will feel) - [Ruya] is married to [Gui Yin] at this time. She wants to let you stay, but because of your work, you have to live with the "expert" "Inn".
When you said goodbye, I regretted not seeing [Gan Ma] (she was not at home that day)...
In the following days, you followed [Zheng Hanzhen] every day without escaping from the scorching heat, going over the mountains to the north of "Jilingping" for inspection, and only returned to the "Inn" at dusk...
Yesterday (September 15th), [Zheng Hanzhen] got up early and locked himself in his room, telling you not to disturb him. In the afternoon, [Falcon] came to the "Inn" and was shocked when he saw you. He dragged you to the pub in the "Inn" to reminisce about old times... You drank and chatted, and the more you talked, the more you talked, and we separated drunkenly late at night. , you only remember being supported and taken back to your residence.
Today (September 16th), you woke up in the "Di Zi Fang", and you can't remember what you said yesterday when you were drunk... [Zheng Hanzhen] was not in the room, the hotel owner said he would go Visited "Bajia". You were afraid that you would delay your work, so you ran to "Bakang Village" to chase [Zheng Hanzhen] regardless of your hangover and headache.
After you entered the village, you saw [Falcon] and [Zheng Hanzhen]. Just as you were about to say hello, you saw [Ruya] carrying a "basket" - then a woman wearing a "mask" stopped her (the voice sounded like Gan Ma), and then you notice that there is a woman (Chen Sha) who is not dressed like the one in "Bakang Village" standing nearby...

The story after the pleasantries
Everyone accepted the invitation of [Falcon] and came to the "hall" of "Bajia" to dine. There was homemade "rice wine" at the table - [Gan Ma] never took off his "mask" and never ate or drank. -[Ba Mansion Mountain] is not at home. I heard someone said that he and "Wizard" [Gui Yin] went out early in the morning.
After finishing the meal, the servants cleared the table and served refreshments. At this time, you heard [Ba Mansion Mountain] and [Gui Yin] talking while returning to "Ba's House". They continued talking outside the "hall" door - You vaguely heard [Ba Mansion Mountain] ask: "...who is it?" [Gui Yin] said: "I guess...·...this person was there..." [ Ba Mansion Mountain] then said: "If that's the case, I will go to the "old wooden house"..." [Gui Yin] lowered his voice: "...the one closest to the river..." ." [Ba Mansion Mountain] said fiercely: "If it is true... I can't forgive you..." [Gui Yin] said: "I will go back and use "Ling Divination" to confirm... ....Bring that incense with you..."
[Falcon] opened the door and went out at this time, and the conversation outside immediately stopped - because when you opened the door, you saw [Ba Mansion Mountain] and [Gui Yin] outside the door. They were very dirty and did not pay attention to you... ··[Gui Yin] said goodbye to [Ba Mansion Mountain], [Ruya] took [Gan Ma] and [Gui Yin] home, and [Gan Ma] pulled [Chen Sha] and left together.
[Zheng Hanzhen] got up and went out to see [Ba Mansion Mountain]. [Ba Mansion Mountain] said that he was going to wash up and would go out soon. He asked [Falcon] to stay with [Zheng Hanzhen] and wait for him to come back in the afternoon to receive him well.
[Falcon] and [Zheng Hanzhen] returned to the "lobby" and chatted for a few words - you could tell that [Falcon] was worried, and then you thought that when you drank with him yesterday, he seemed to look like this... At this moment, you suddenly thought that after drinking yesterday, you met your second brother [Li Liangsong] - he supported you when you were drunk, talked a lot, and then asked you to go to the west of "Stone Bridge" outside the east gate of the village today. Meeting him by the river... After you remembered it, you immediately told [Zheng Hanzhen] that you had a place to go, and then left in a hurry. When you walked out, you saw the Western clock in the "lobby" pointing to 1 p.m. (13:00).
You quickly rushed to the river west of the "Stone Bridge" outside the east gate of the village and saw your second brother sitting in a small boat tied to the shore. You hurried over to say hello, and your second brother asked you to sit next to him and asked in a low voice: "Are you ready? I have rented a boat..." Just when you were about to ask your second brother what was going on, he He suddenly stopped talking and stared at the east gate of the village. You turned around and saw [Falcon] over there... The second brother asked you to leave quickly and come back later to avoid being seen by people from the "Ba family". After saying that, he lay down on the boat and pretended that he didn't know you.
After you got ashore, you walked towards "Panglu Lake", full of doubts in your heart. Soon you returned to the river west of "Stone Bridge" to look for your second brother, but he and the boat were gone. You tried hard to recall what happened last night, and finally remembered The second brother said these words "after the death of the eldest brother"... You had always used the Gregorian calendar in school before. Now you calculated in your mind that today is the 27th day of the seventh lunar month, which is the anniversary of the eldest brother's death. !
You remember that the person who performed the autopsy on your eldest brother was [Gui Yin] - because you were young at the time and a relative had passed away, you didn't know much about it. Now you plan to go to the "Wizard's house" to find him and ask about the details of that year.
You walked into the "Bakang Village" and saw [Ruya] carrying a "basket" covered with "flower cloth" from a distance towards the west gate of the village. You called her, but she seemed not to hear and walked out of the "Bakang Village". Kangzhai".
You walked into the main house of "Wizard's House" and went up to the second floor. You remember that [Gui Yin] often stayed alone in the "quiet room" during the day (the "quiet room" contains "Wizard's" medicine and a shrine, which leads to the "terrace" "), you went to knock on the door, but no one answered inside. When you pushed the door, you found that the door latch was inserted inside - you knew when [Gui Yin] worked here before that when performing "witchcraft" in the "quiet room", you would Put the door latch in place.
You have heard people in the village say that the "Wizard" will use a kind of "spiritual divination", which is different from ordinary divination. You must first enter concentration and then communicate with the "Mountain Spirit", so you must not be disturbed - otherwise you will All your previous efforts will be wasted, and in severe cases, you may be tempted by inner demons and lead to suicide!
You remember that when you were at the "Bajia", you heard [Gui Yin] say, "I'll go back and use the "spiritual divination" to confirm..." You didn't dare to knock on the door again for fear of disturbing him and causing an accident.
You left the "Wizard's house" and wanted to wait for [Gui Yin] to finish his "divination" before coming to see him again.
You then returned to "Bajia" to find [Zheng Hanzhen], but you didn't see him in the "hall". I heard from your servants that [Zheng Hanzhen] also went out shortly after you and [Falcon] left one after another - at this time you See the "Western clock" in the "lobby" pointing to 2 p.m. (14:00).
You walk out of "Bajia", look at the west gate of the village, and think of the "naked woman" you saw in the "cemetery" that night - as long as you think of that scene, you will feel a wonderful feeling in your body and mind... ····
You hesitated on the spot, not only afraid of being discovered robbing the tomb, but also wanting to go there and take another look - even if you could find some clues related to the "naked woman"!
After all, you can't resist the impulse in your heart, so you walk out of the west gate of the village and enter the "cemetery".
When you come to the place where you saw the "naked woman", you thought there was no one else in the "cemetery", but you see [Zheng Hanzhen] digging a grave with [Falcon] who is covered in mud and water!
At this time, [Ruya] came from the opposite side, and you had nowhere to hide, so you walked over and saw [Zheng Hanzhen] and [Falcon] lifting a "thin board coffin" from the dug grave - you caught a glimpse The tombstone on the side has the words "Ba Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)". You immediately think that this is the tomb of your daughter at [Ba Mansion Mountain] that was stolen by you and your second brother. You feel nervous and can't help but stare at the coffin and see The coffin lid was not nailed shut, it was just placed on top!
[Zheng Hanzhen] and [Falcon] worked together to lift the coffin lid. Inside was a partially decomposed male corpse. His face was vaguely visible. The clothes on his body looked like those of your elder brother. You should immediately look at the male corpse’s face and identify him. It’s the long-dead eldest brother [Li Demu]!
[Ruya] At this moment, you let out an exclamation, and you almost knelt on the ground. You didn't understand why your elder brother's body returned to "Sisters' Cemetery"... Only then did you notice that he was wearing a "mask" and his clothes were wet. [Gan Ma] appeared behind [Ruya] at some unknown time.
Immediately afterwards, the soaked [Chen Sha] also ran from behind you. She was panting heavily and approached the coffin. After seeing the body inside, she shouted in a trembling voice: "The people inside... ..It’s Li Demu!”
You are shocked and don’t know why other people came here...

next story
At about 16:30, everyone returned to "Bakang Village" and saw "Grandma" playing with her grandson on the roadside. She sang a song belonging to "Ghost Moon" (the seventh month of the lunar calendar). : "Don't go into the water before and after the Zhongyuan Dynasty (yo), if you drown, you will find a scapegoat (yo); don't sleep under a tree in July (yo), if you hang yourself, you will find a scapegoat (yo)..."
After you saw what [Chen Sha] and [Gan Ma] said, you ran to the east gate of the village alone.
You had something to say and wanted to ask your second brother, so you quietly avoided everyone - you remembered that your second brother had asked you to "come back later" before, and you thought he might return to the river west of the "Stone Bridge", so you just waited. 【Chen Sha】After leaving for a while, he walked out of the east gate of the village. You didn't see your second brother on the west side of the "Stone Bridge" outside the east gate of the village, so you stayed there waiting for him.
At about 17:00, the second brother still didn’t show up. You couldn’t help but become irritated and wanted to go back to find [Gui Yin] - the second brother said that after you saw the body of the eldest brother, [Gui Yin] would immediately ask you to find [Ba Mansion Mountain] 】, and then he ordered the second brother to buy a coffin and take you all away. The second brother was convinced that the eldest brother was strangled, but he never saw the "rope" that hung the eldest brother again. He only remembered that there were some Brown traces, made into nooses tied to trees...
You return to "Bakang Village", walk into the main house of "Wizard's House", go up to the second floor, and see that the door of the "Quiet Room" is still closed. When you push it, you feel that the door latch is still inserted inside. You didn't dare to knock on the door, so you had to go downstairs.
When you walked out of the "Wizard's House", you saw [Ruya] looking outside the door, and asked her in a low voice how long [Gui Yin] had been in the "Quiet Room"? [Ruya] said that after her husband came back at noon, he locked himself in and asked others not to disturb him... (As far as you know, if Gui Yin sees an outsider entering the "quiet room", he will definitely call him After the servant "Yi Bo" drove the other party away), you saw [Falcon] and [Zheng Hanzhen] walking side by side. They both changed into clean clothes, followed by several servants of the "Ba Family".
You met outside the "Wizard's House", and [Falcon] just asked: "Is Gui Yin out?" You saw [Gan Ma] wearing a "mask" panting and running away from the east gate of the village. come over.
[Gan Ma] ran to the door and shouted: "My brother is in trouble!" Then he ran into the main house of the "Wizard's House" - you followed her into the house and climbed up the stairs on the west side to the second floor together.
[Gan Ma] tried hard to hit the door of the "quiet room", but couldn't open it because of the latch inside.
[Falcon] grabbed [Gan Ma] and asked several servants to bump into it, and finally broke the door open - there was no one in the "quiet room", and there were some things scattered on the ground - [Gan Ma] ran to the "terrace" first, You follow her and see a "rope" tied to the east railing of the "terrace", as if something is hanging outside...
You saw [Falcon] hugging [Gan Ma], both of them shaking - at this time [Chen Sha] who had changed into clean clothes also appeared on the "terrace". [Zheng Hanzhen] whispered to you to take a look - you immediately ran to the "railing", looked down, and saw the "rope" wrapped around the neck of a man wearing a "black robe" - after you saw it clearly He couldn't help shouting: "It's Gui Yin!"
[Ruya] shouted in shock: "Pull him up quickly!"
【Zheng Hanzhen】Come over immediately, work with you to pull up the "rope", pull up a corpse with the "rope" tightly wrapped around the neck from outside the "balcony", and lay it flat on the "balcony" - the deceased is[Gui Yin]!
The sun has not set yet, but you suddenly feel a chill... Maybe [Gui Yin] is not the only one who died today...
