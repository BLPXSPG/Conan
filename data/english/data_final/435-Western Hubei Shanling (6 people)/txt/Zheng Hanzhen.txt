story background
September 16, 1914 (the third year of the Republic of China)
As early as the late Qing Dynasty, someone proposed to build a "Sichuan-Hankou Railway" connecting Hubei and Sichuan provinces and running through the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River. After that, private funds were raised to establish a railway company to conduct surveys along the route in Hubei.
In the second year of Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty (1910), a professor came to "Jilingping" in western Hubei to inspect the landforms. The manager there was the owner of the "Bakang Village" who owned a large area of ​​land and the "Mountain Spirit" who had been worshiping the "Mountain Spirit" for generations. The "Wizard" who controls life and death.
In June of the third year of the Republic of China (1914), after Zhan Tianyou served as the "Han-Yue-Sichuan Railway Supervisor" of the Ministry of Transportation of the Beiyang Government, he formed a survey team and separately conducted a re-survey of the section from Hubei to Sichuan. In August, a young expert and his assistant came to "Jilingping" for inspection. I don't know what the result will be this time...
your story
Your name is [Zheng Hanzhen], you were born in the 17th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty (1891), your zodiac sign is Rabbit, and you are from Wuhan, Hubei. You come from a scholarly family, your grandfather was a civil servant, and your father "Zheng Changmin" is a "famous seal carver". If you like "geography", your family will send you to the "Chongli School" (a high school with high tuition fees) that has this major. You will meet Professor Zhou (Zhou Yuntang) who is passionate about Chu folk customs and legends. A good friend of your father's.
When you were 20 years old (in 1910), [Professor Zhou] was going to "Jilingping" for inspection. You followed as an "Intern", and traveling with you was [Professor Zhou]'s daughter [Chen Sha].
After arriving at "Jilingping", you checked into the "Yizhan" hostel. This was your first field trip. You followed the Professor and his daughter over the mountains and ridges every day, but you couldn't even outrun [Chen Sha] - it was the sixth day of the lunar calendar. In March, the sun was blazing, and you, who was inexperienced, fell ill from heatstroke and were sent to the nearby "Bakang Village" for medical treatment. The big landowner [Ba Mansion Mountain] in the village asked you to stay in "Bajia" to recuperate. [Professor Zhou] took a "Guide" recommended by [Ba Mansion Mountain] to continue the investigation, leaving [Chen Sha] in "Bajia". Home" takes care of you.
[Chen Sha] was only 16 years old at the time, full of energy, but not good at taking care of others. When he got bored at home, he went out to play - you all relied on [Ba Mansion Mountain]’s 18-year-old daughter [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song) 】Take care of him and he will recover quickly.
When you and [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] got along, you had a crush on each other and soon fell in love, but she was already engaged to the "Wizard" [Gui Yin] in the village - you can only hide it from others and go A secret tryst at "Xiya" where few people visit.
"Xiya" is full of red mountain flowers. [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] tells you that these are "Mountain Spirit flowers". There is also a "Mountain Spirit Cave" nearby. When she was a child, she heard her mother say that as long as she prays sincerely, The "Wizard" will pray to the "Mountain Spirit" to relieve people's pain... But the "Mountain Spirit" has taboos (such as murder and arson, adultery between men and women, and stealing belongings of gods or the dead, are all taboos), the person who violates the taboo must sacrifice his life to be forgiven. The "Wizard" in the past generations has always been supervising the "Sister Ping" on behalf of the "Mountain Spirit"... This is the rule of the "Sister Ping", and it is the king in everyone's hearts. The law is important!
[Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] I like to sing a "Mountain Spirit song": "Mountain Spirit is not afraid of being pricked by needles (eh), Mountain Spirit is happy to be rubbed with a bamboo knife (eh), Mountain Spirit sheds tears and sheds white flowers (eh), Mountain Spirit "Spirit Li Shui, lover praises (eh)..." She always sings and dances to the rhythm, making you intoxicated.
When you hear "Mountain Spirit", you think of the record you read in "E Feng Luo Ji" when you were a child. It is probably that "Mountain Spirit" and "Scholar" lived a happy life, but they were coveted by a greedy "rich man" Magical power, and later the "rich man" used the "Wizard" to try and take away the "Mountain Spirit" from the "scholar"... You have long forgotten the following content.
You were born in the Year of the Rabbit, and you carried with you the "Rabbit Seal", one of the twelve zodiac signs carved by your father, so you took it out and gave it to [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)]. She was very happy and said she would always keep it with her... ····You wantonly enjoy the joy with [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] in the sea of ​​​​flaming red flowers, but you don’t know that the good time is about to come to an end...
On the second day of the seventh lunar month, the Professor went to "Bajia" to pick up you and [Chen Sha] who had recovered, and returned to the hotel in the "Inn" - at this time, the Professor had already completed the inspection of "Eagle River" with the help of the "Guide" Nan'an, let you send some of the inspection materials back to Wuhan - you have to say goodbye to [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] temporarily. [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] was crying when he saw you off, and you were very reluctant to leave, but Thinking that I would be back soon, I left without looking back...
On the 18th day of the seventh lunar month, you return to "Jilingping" and first go to the "Inn" to meet the Professor and [Chen Sha]. You learn that the Professor has inspected all the northeastern mountainous areas of "Jilingping" after you left. , only "Houya" is left.
[Professor Zhou] wants to go to "Xiya" for inspection first. You know that it is the land of [Ba Mansion Mountain] and needs his permission. You have not contributed much to the inspection before, so you take the initiative to ask for [Ba] on behalf of Professor. Mansion Mountain] agreed, [Chen Sha] also went to "Bajia" with you.
[Ba Mansion Mountain], who had been supporting the Professor's work before, went against the norm and said that "Xiya" has a dangerous "Mountain Spirit" and prohibited inspections - you guess he didn't want his land to be passed by the railway, so he used this excuse... ····You really want to see [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] at this time, but she is not at home.
After that, the Professor went to "Bajia" to beg for help several times, but was rejected all the time. He wanted to go directly from "Dongya", but was blocked by the young farmhand [Li Demu] from "Bajia", so the Professor tried to find a way to go from another place. When passing through "Bakang Village" to "Xiya", a tragedy quietly began...
On the 27th day of the seventh lunar month, [Li Demu] was found hanging in the woods near the "Wooden Bridge" in "Xiya". People said that he was possessed by the "Mountain Spirit" and committed suicide. ······[Chen Sha] After hearing this, I was trembling with fear, but the Professor did not believe this kind of thing, and still wanted to go to "Xiya" to find out (because you concealed your relationship with Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song) who was already engaged ), and did not tell the Professor about "Mountain Spirit").
There was chaos on the ground because of the death. You took the opportunity to run to "Bajia" to see [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] - she looked very haggard, but her eyes brightened up after seeing you, [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] told you that she and [Gui Yin] have already set a wedding date...you immediately said you were going to elope with her! [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] was very scared, saying that this would violate the taboo of the "Mountain Spirit" - she had sworn not to betray the "Wizard"...
You were young and energetic at the time, and told [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] that as long as you leave "Sister Lingping" and don't say a "Wizard", even the "Mountain Spirit" will have no control over you - you will take [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] Fly far away, go to the provincial capital, and then go abroad...【Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)】I shed tears after listening to it, and promised to go to the "Inn" to find you the day after tomorrow (the 29th of the seventh lunar month), Let me go with you and never come back.
On the 29th day of the seventh lunar month, you get up early and wait anxiously for [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)]. [Chen Sha] suddenly came to you and said her father was missing! When the two of you didn't find the Professor at the "Inn", [Chen Sha] took you and her to look outside, and said that her father might be in danger!
After that, [Chen Sha] will take you over the mountain to the east of "Jiling Pagoda" to "Dongya", then cross the bridge, find "Xiya" all the way (because Li Demu is dead, no one stopped him), and finally walk into The "Mountain Spirit Cave".
The "Mountain Spirit Cave" is very deep. The light inside the cave is dim and the smell is unpleasant. There is an unburned candle on the stone table near the entrance of the cave. [Professor Zhou] is sitting at the table, holding a handful that seems to be his luggage. "Dagger" in the middle, lowered his head, muttering to himself: "Mountain Spirit...I, Zhou Yuntang, finally saw...I will never forget..." You And [Chen Sha] called the Professor, but he just raised his head, but had no other response - [Chen Sha] gritted his teeth and said to go find the "Wizard" to save people, and let you watch her father in the cave.
【Chen Sha】Not long after you left, the Professor stared at your back and shouted: "You're back!" You were startled and looked back, but saw no one... At this time, the Professor Like crazy, he rushed over with the "dagger" and knocked you to the ground - Professor then ran out of the cave, and you heard him shout: "This is yours...it's yours... ...." When you got up, the Professor had already run away. You chased him outside the cave and suddenly heard a woman's scream - it was the voice of [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)]!
You followed the screams and when you were about to reach the "wooden bridge", you saw [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] dressed in red being caught by two people. One of the men was wearing a "black robe" and the other was [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)]’s father [Ba Mansion Mountain]-[Ba Mansion Mountain] is asking [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] sternly with whom he wants to elope? [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] just shook his head. You were afraid that the affair between you and [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] would be exposed, so you were timid and hid in the nearby woods - this decision will make you regret it for the rest of your life in the blink of an eye!
"Man in Black Robe" constantly reminds [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] of the oath he made to him: never cheat and give what you want! He also said that as long as [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] tells who the other person is, he will forgive [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)]. [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] said that everything was her fault and that she could not keep her oath. Before she finished speaking, [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] pulled out the "dagger" from [Ba Mansion Mountain]'s waist and stabbed her. into his heart, holding the handle of the knife with both hands, and fell down...
You were so frightened that your mind went blank. It wasn’t until [Ba Mansion Mountain] and “Man in Black Robe” walked eastward across the “wooden bridge” that you dared to walk over and saw that [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] had already Death - You hugged the body that was still warm, and your heart ached... I don’t know how long it took before you figured out that [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] protected you with her death (if Ba Mansion Mountain asks If you want to elope with Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song), I will definitely not let you go) - Since you were lucky enough not to be discovered, you must survive and find an opportunity to personally kill the two people who forced [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] to commit suicide. People take revenge! When you think of this, you wipe away your tears, put down the body, lower your head and walk towards the south...
You heard [Chen Sha] screaming on the way, and ran to the "Eagle River" south of the "Mountain Spirit Cave" in search of the sound. You saw [Professor Zhou] lying on the ground with multiple wounds on his body, stained by the blood flowing out. A large piece of red flowers, the person has long since died, but there is a smile on his face... [Chen Sha] is kneeling aside, crying and calling for his father.
You witnessed the death of familiar people one after another, and you were at a loss for a while... Later you met [Ba Mansion Mountain] again. He and "Man in Black Robe" passed by carrying a covered "thin board coffin". You immediately rush over and ask who is in the coffin, [Ba Mansion Mountain] says that it is his daughter [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)]!
You held back your grief and took the initiative to help the two enemies carry the "thin coffin" into the "cemetery" and park it in the "Ba Family" tomb area. Then [Ba Mansion Mountain] asked the servants of the "Ba Family" to go with you. Collect the corpse for the Professor and send it to the "Sister Tomb Pagoda" for burial... After doing all this, you accompany [Chen Sha] back to the hotel at the "Inn" and leave her to rest while you go out to inquire. It turns out that "Man in Black Robe" is the "Wizard" [Gui Yin] in the village, which is also the "fiancé" of [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)].
The next day (the 30th day of the seventh lunar month), you went to the "cemetery" to attend the funeral of [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)], and saw the "thin board coffin" being buried underground, and your heart felt like a knife twisting - at that time [Professor Zhou 】The bones are still cold, and the whereabouts of the murderer and the murder weapon are unknown.
The people in the village were busy with the funeral of the "Ba family", and the weather was hot, so the corpse could not be kept for a long time. [Ba Mansion Mountain] personally promised that he would be responsible for finding out the truth about Professor's murder. After [Chen Sha] calmed down a little, you hired a carriage at the "Inn" and accompanied her to take Professor's body back to Yichang, Professor's hometown. He was buried soon after the autopsy... You were about to return to Wuhan after attending the Professor's funeral. When you parted with [Chen Sha], you told her not to go to "Sister Lingping" again. There are no good people in that place. !
From then on, every time you dream about Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song) at midnight, you will think of [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)], and his voice and smile are just like when he was alive - the hatred in your heart has not faded with the passage of time, but has become stronger with the thought - you have to wait for a chance , you can return to "Sister Lingping" without suspicion and complete your revenge! At the same time, you also regarded your discomfort and heatstroke during the inspection as a shameful "mistake" and determined not to do it again. From then on, you continued to exercise, build up your physical strength, learn to climb and row, and actively participated in various field inspections.
In June of this year (1914), you have become somewhat famous. As a "survey expert", you were invited to participate in the route re-survey of the "Sichuan-Hankou Railway" - you and others studied the railway planning together, and everyone expressed their opinions. You couldn't decide for a long time - you didn't go home for half a month because of continuous meetings, and finally got the task of inspecting the "Jilingping" road reconnaissance section again.
When you came home, your father told you that [Professor Zhou]’s son [Zhou Jingyu] had come to visit, and the purpose was actually for his sister [Chen Sha]’s life-long event. It turns out that your father and [Professor Zhou] had a long relationship with you and [Chen Sha]. Sha] made a promise to be engaged before he was born, but he never told you - [Professor Zhou] hopes that you can get to know [Chen Sha] first, and wait until you develop a good relationship before it's too late. Your mother (Zhang Shi) said confidently back then: "Professor Zhou's daughter and my son have a predestined relationship, and they will definitely like each other after meeting..."
Therefore, your family did not send a formal betrothal gift - now [Chen Sha]'s filial piety period has long ended, and she is old enough to get married at this time, so her mother asked her son [Zhou Jingyu] to come to the "Zheng family" to ask when she would be there. Xiapin - If she didn't mean it, she would have found [Chen Sha]'s in-laws - You were not at home at the time, and your parents didn't answer. [Zhou Jingyu] only stayed for one night and then left.
Since you were going to "Jilingping" soon, you told your family that the marriage would be decided upon your return.
In July, you have completed all the procedures (you need the Yamen to sign a "letter of appointment" to appoint you as a special investigator from the provincial capital to go to "Jilingping" for public investigation. The local government should provide assistance), and you also want to hire a "letter of appointment". "Assistant", but because of the difficult conditions and low salary, only one student named [Li Gaobai] applied.
Before you set off, you looked through the materials that [Professor Zhou] asked you to send back, and brought some "newspapers" with you for entertainment.
In August, you came to "Jilingping" again and took [Li Gaobai] to live in the "dizi room" of the "Yizhan" hotel. After that, you go to "Bajia" alone to see [Ba Mansion Mountain] and explain your purpose of coming. [Ba Mansion Mountain] I hope you can arrange the route to the south bank of the "Eagle River" - You see he still has the "short knife" used by [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] to commit suicide on his waist, so you didn't hear what he said clearly. What - the "Ba family" has a large number of people, so you don't dare to take action easily, you can only continue to wait.
After that, you take [Li Gaobai] to the north of "Jilingping" to inspect "Dongya" and "Northeast Mountains" - you don't need to go to the south bank anymore, [Professor Zhou] has already left enough information.
Yesterday (September 15th), you completed the inspection (you have been to "Xiya" with Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song) before, and you know it by heart). Since getting up early, you have been organizing information in the guest room so that [Li Gaobai] does not Disturb you.
Your work at "Jilingping" has ended at this time, and all that is left is to recommend a reasonable route to your superiors... and to personally kill [Ba Mansion Mountain] and [Gui Yin] who made you lose your beloved. 
In the evening, [Li Gaobai] was sent back to the "dizifang" by a "Dark and Thin Man" (who looked like a farmhand dressed in clothes) and was already drunk.
Today (September 16th), you need to know the movements of your enemy, so you plan to visit the "Ba family". Before you go out, you tell the hotel owner where you are going and ask him to tell him when [Li Gaobai] wakes up from a hangover, so as not to He went around looking for you - you came to "Bakang Village" and met a Youth (Falcon). At this time, [Li Gaobai] chased you, and a woman wearing a "mask" (Gan Ma) not far away called out. A woman (Ruya) carrying a "basket" on her back.
You suddenly see a familiar figure next to the woman wearing a "mask" - you know only a handful of people in "Bakang Village", you almost thought it was [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)], but if you look carefully, Only then did I recognize that it was [Chen Sha] who I hadn’t seen for a few years and had grown up.

The story after the pleasantries
Everyone accepted the invitation of [Falcon] and came to the "hall" of "Bajia" to dine. There was homemade "rice wine" at the table - [Gan Ma] never took off his "mask" and never ate or drank. -[Ba Mansion Mountain] is not at home. I heard someone said that he and "Wizard" [Gui Yin] went out early in the morning.
After finishing the meal, the servants cleared the table and served tea. At this time, you heard [Ba Mansion Mountain] and another man talking while returning to "Ba's House". They continued talking outside the "hall" door - you I vaguely heard [Ba Mansion Mountain] ask: "...Who is it?" The man said: "I guess... this person was there back then..." [Ba Mansion Mountain] Then he said: "If that's the case, I will go to the "old wooden house"..." The man lowered his voice: "...the one closest to the river..." [Ba Mansion Mountain ]Said fiercely: "If it is true...I can't forgive..." The man said: "I will go back and use the "spiritual divination" to confirm...then I will bring the incense." ..."
[Falcon] opens the door and goes out at this time, and the conversation outside immediately stops - because when you open the door, you see [Ba Mansion Mountain] and [Gui Yin] wearing a "black robe" outside the door, both of them are very dirty· ·····They were the ones having a conversation just now. [Gui Yin] said goodbye to [Ba Mansion Mountain], [Ruya] took [Gan Ma] and [Gui Yin] home, and [Gan Ma] pulled [Chen Sha] and left together.
You also come out to see [Ba Mansion Mountain], and see that he looks bad - [Ba Mansion Mountain] says that he needs to wash up first, and will go out soon. Ask [Falcon] to accompany you, and wait until he comes back in the afternoon to receive him well.
[Falcon] and you returned to the "lobby". After chatting for a few words, [Li Gaobai] said that he had a place to go, and then left in a hurry. At this time, you saw the Western clock in the "lobby" pointing to 1 p.m. (13:00). [Falcon] also took a look at the "Western Clock", said he was going to meet someone, and walked out.
You followed behind quietly and saw [Falcon] walking towards the east gate of the village after leaving "Bajia". You turned around and saw [Ruya] walking towards the west gate of the village carrying a "basket on her back", so you caught up with her and exchanged a few words with her. Ask her if [Chen Sha] is at the "Wizard's house". You have something important to see her (you pretend to come to see Chen Sha). [Ruya] said she was here, and then took you, who had never been to the "Wizard's House", to the east side of the "Wizard's House" (a suspended "stilted building" on the side of the river). When you went upstairs, you vaguely heard the sound of falling water. .
[Ruya] said that [Chen Sha] should be inside with [Gan Ma] now, and then she walked downstairs. You push the door open and see that the window is open. No one is inside. There is a "bell" and a bag on the ground (you think it belongs to Chen Sha). You go to the window and see a small boat on the "Tiger River" outside. There is no one on the water or on the boat. The bow of the boat is facing east and tied to the west pillar on the north side of the east side of the house. The hull faces the main house of "Wizard's House". "Terrace" on the 2nd floor.
You didn't see [Chen Sha], so you went downstairs and pretended to leave, but turned around and entered the main house of "Wizard's House". When you heard hurried footsteps upstairs on the west side, you hid in the "corral" and " In the aisle in the middle of the warehouse, I saw [Gan Ma] wearing a "mask" going downstairs.
You go up to the 2nd floor and see the "quiet room" with the door open. [Gui Yin] is inside with his back to the door, squatting to pick up things. There is a "rope" with brown traces thrown on the ground - this is what killed him Opportunity!
You carefully walked into the "quiet room", picked up the "rope" and put it around [Gui Yin's] neck from behind, and quickly strangled him to death before he could call anyone. You then closed the door of the "quiet room", fastened the latch, dragged [Gui Yin]'s body to the "terrace", and then tied both ends of the "rope" to the railing on the east side of the "terrace" (facing the boat below) (the hull of the ship), at this time you see [Gui Yin] holding a "paper bag" in his hand, and you want to take it, but unexpectedly the deceased held it too tightly, and part of it was torn off when you took it.
You see that the "paper bag" you got has the word "MI" and half of the word "soul" written on it. It contains fragrant medicine - you have heard of the fragrant medicine that can make people comatose and unable to move when lit, so you stuff it into your pocket. .
You then pushed [Gui Yin]'s body off the "terrace" and hung it on the side of the "Wizard's house" facing the river. Then you climb down to the corpse through the "rope", then continue to climb down and land on the boat - when you come down, you grab the hem of the "black robe" on [Gui Yin] and tear off a piece of "black cloth".
You untied the rope that tied the boat, and the boat drifted down the current to "Dongya". You found something to hold the boat, and on the way you saw [Ba Mansion Mountain] taking a few people, walking towards the "Old Wooden House" - you thought I heard the conversation between him and [Gui Yin] before, and I guessed that he wanted to go to "the one closest to the river" - the boat going down the river is faster than walking, so you first reach the waterside on the west side of the "old wooden house".
You row the boat to the river, pull the rope ashore, tie the boat to a tree, climb up the slope where the "old wooden house" is, and go around to the window of the "dormitory" "near the river" (because it is summer) , the windows are all open. When you see that there is no one in the room, go inside, use the "match" (match) on the table to light the "ecstasy" you brought, then go out through the window, close the window, and ball up the empty "paper bag" Throw it into the "Tiger River".
After about 14:00, after you heard someone entering the house, you seemed to have bolted the door, kept rummaging around, and soon fell down due to the power of "Ecstasy". You stuffed your nostrils with the torn "black cloth", opened the window to get some air, and then turned in. When you saw [Ba Mansion Mountain] passed out on the ground, you took out [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] from his waist and committed suicide. The "short knife" was inserted into his heart with force (the same way of death as Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)) - [Ba Mansion Mountain] Woke up in pain, grabbed the handle of the knife with your hand, and you held it down hard. After struggling for a few times, he died. died.
You see someone outside the window at this time - that person also sees you and runs away immediately. You rolled out the window and saw the man running downhill towards the "Tiger River", so you chased him all the way to the river, caught the man, and recognized him as the man who sent [Li Gaobai] back yesterday - you knew he had witnessed you murder, They faced each other and pressed his head into the river to silence him! After a man drowned, you pushed his body into the "Tiger River" and watched it drift away. Then you untied the boat, boarded it and rowed to the other side - you walked ashore and saw that this was the west of the village, not far from the "cemetery" , thinking that [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] was buried inside, in a daze, he forgot to tie the boat, and could only watch the boat going down the river... Only then did you realize that there was nothing in your nostrils I recall that before he died, the man you drowned grabbed with his hands and pulled off the "black cloth" that stuffed your nostrils.
If you want to say goodbye at the grave of [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)], you go along the mountain road and go around to the east entrance of the "cemetery" and walk in, only to see a soaked [Falcon] in the tomb of the "Bajia" Zone. [Falcon] After seeing you, he threw a "shovel" over and asked you to help him dig his grave, saying that his sister might not be dead! You were shocked, and immediately dug hard - you quickly dug out a "thin board coffin", then threw down the "shovel" and worked together to lift the coffin up from the excavated soil - the coffin lid was not nailed, just covered. !
You and [Falcon] opened the coffin lid together and saw a partially decomposed male corpse inside - definitely not [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)]! At this time, you heard a female exclamation and noticed that there were other people in the "cemetery" - [Li Gaobai] standing on the east side, [Ruya] standing on the west side, and behind her were people wearing "masks", [Gan Ma] whose clothes are wet.
Immediately afterwards, [Chen Sha], who was soaked all over, ran into the "cemetery" from the west side. She gasped for air, approached the coffin, saw the corpse inside, and shouted with a trembling voice: "The people inside... .....It’s Li Demu!”
Your shock at the moment is far greater than killing someone, and you don’t know why the others are here...
You can say that you just went to the "Wizard's house" to look for [Chen Sha], but you didn't see anyone. You guessed that she might have gone to the place where [Professor Zhou] was killed (by the "Eagle River" south of the "Mountain Spirit Cave"), you have I want to talk to [Chen Sha] about important things (such as marriage), and I am anxious to find her, so I want to go through the "cemetery" to "Xiya", and then I meet [Falcon], who asks you to help him dig his grave· ·····(You can also make up other contents that are not suspected)

next story
At about 16:30, everyone returned to "Bakang Village" and saw "Grandma" playing with her grandson on the roadside. She sang a song belonging to "Ghost Moon" (the seventh month of the lunar calendar). : "Don't go into the water before and after the Zhongyuan Dynasty (yo), if you drown, you will find a scapegoat (yo); don't sleep under a tree in July (yo), if you hang yourself, you will find a scapegoat (yo)..."
You helped [Falcon] dig a grave earlier and got yourself dirty, so [Falcon] took you back to "Ba's House" to take a shower and change clothes.
After the servants boiled the water, [Falcon] went to take a bath first. After he changed his clothes and came out, he asked the servants to clean the wooden bathtub, boil the water again, and put you in. You soaked in the wooden bathtub filled with warm water and saw a set of [ Falcon] Clean clothes left for you.
When you were taking a shower, you kept thinking about whether there were any flaws in your previous actions (the boat should have drifted away with the current), and then you thought about the time when [Professor Zhou]’s body was sent back to his hometown, and before it was buried, his family had invited An autopsy was performed on the case and it was found that the Professor had 6 stab wounds of varying depths, 2 of which were deep (fatal wounds). Judging from the wounds, the murder weapon was probably a "dagger" (the blade was about 15cmx3cm)... ···You are worried because [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)]'s body has disappeared, and you have even imagined that [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] is still alive - but is resurrection from the dead really possible?
At about 17:00, after you took a shower and changed clothes, you didn't see [Falcon]. After a while, [Falcon] came back. After you saw him, you deliberately asked where his father was. You had something to discuss with his father about the railway line - [Falcon] said he didn't know. Then [Falcon] looked restless, and soon he said he wanted to go to the "Wizard's house" again, so you asked to go with him.
[Falcon] called a few servants to follow him out - before you reached the "Wizard's house", you saw [Ruya] looking outside the door, [Li Gaobai] walked out of the main room, and whispered to [Ruya] said something.
You met outside the "Wizard's House", and [Falcon] just asked: "Is Gui Yin out?" You saw [Gan Ma] wearing a "mask" panting and running away from the east gate of the village. come over.
[Gan Ma] ran to the door and shouted: "My brother is in trouble!" Then he ran into the main house of the "Wizard's House" - you followed her into the house and climbed up the stairs on the west side to the second floor together.
[Gan Ma] tried hard to hit the door of the "quiet room", but couldn't open it because of the latch inside.
[Falcon] grabbed [Gan Ma] and asked several servants to bump into it, and finally broke the door open - there was no one in the "quiet room", and there were some things scattered on the ground - [Gan Ma] ran to the "terrace" first, You follow her and see a "rope" tied to the east railing of the "terrace", as if something is hanging outside...
You saw [Falcon] hugging [Gan Ma], both of them were shaking - at this time [Chen Sha] who had changed into clean clothes also appeared on the "terrace" - because [Chen Sha] and [Ruya] She is a woman (you don’t want women to be frightened when looking at the corpse), so you whisper to [Li Gaobai] to take a look - [Li Gaobai] ran to the edge of the "railing", looked down, and then shouted: "It's Gui Yin!"
[Ruya] shouted in shock: "Pull him up quickly!"
You immediately walked over and worked with [Li Gaobai] to pull up the "rope" and pulled up a corpse with the "rope" tightly wrapped around the neck from outside the "terrace" and laid it flat on the "terrace" - the deceased was 【Gui Yin】!
The sun has not set yet, but you suddenly feel a chill... Maybe [Gui Yin] is not the only one who died today...
