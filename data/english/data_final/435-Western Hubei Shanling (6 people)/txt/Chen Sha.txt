story background
September 16, 1914 (the third year of the Republic of China)
As early as the late Qing Dynasty, someone proposed to build a "Sichuan-Hankou Railway" connecting Hubei and Sichuan provinces and running through the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River. After that, private funds were raised to establish a railway company to conduct surveys along the route in Hubei.
In the second year of Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty (1910), a professor came to "Jilingping" in western Hubei to inspect the landforms. The manager there was the owner of the "Bakang Village" who owned a large area of ​​land and the "Mountain Spirit" who had been worshiping the "Mountain Spirit" for generations. The "Wizard" who controls life and death.
In June of the third year of the Republic of China (1914), after Zhan Tianyou served as the "Han-Yue-Sichuan Railway Supervisor" of the Ministry of Transportation of the Beiyang Government, he formed a survey team and separately conducted a re-survey of the section from Hubei to Sichuan. In August, a young expert and his assistant came to "Jilingping" for inspection. I don't know what the result will be this time...
your story
Your name is [Zhou Chen Sha], you were born in the 21st year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty (1895), your zodiac sign is Sheep, and you are from Yichang, Hubei Province.
Your father [Zhou Yuntang] is keen on Chu legends and often travels around. You and your brother [Zhou Jingyu], who are 2 years older than you, grew up listening to your father telling legendary stories - your brother always told you when you were a child that when he grew up, he would also kill monsters and eliminate harm for the people!
Later, your father was hired as a "Professor" at the "Chongli Hall" (higher school) in the provincial capital (Wuhan), and your brother went to study at the "Shengrenzheng University Hall" (medical college) in Changsha. You liked to stick to your father, so he took you to Wuhan, leaving your mother (Wang Shi) at home. From then on, your father would take you with him every time he went on an inspection trip, so that you could train yourself to not lose to the boys no matter whether you were in the mountains or in the water. Skill - After you became literate, you liked to read a copy of your father's "E Feng Luo Ji" (recording the customs of the Chu region and other contents), but you found that a page had been torn out of the book (from the table of contents, the content of that page It is "Western Hubei Mountain Spirit").
When you were 16 years old (1910), your father took you and the son of a good friend [Zheng Hanzhen] (as an intern) to "Jilingping" for inspection and stayed at the "Yizhan" hotel.
[Zheng Hanzhen] Although he is 4 years older than you, he has little experience in outdoor activities. He can’t even outrun you in the mountains. He soon suffered from heatstroke under the sun in the sixth lunar month and was sent to a nearby place by you and your father. Seek medical treatment in the "Bakang Village". The big landowner [Ba Mansion Mountain] in the village was very enthusiastic. He asked [Zheng Hanzhen] to stay in the "Ba Family" to recuperate, and hired a young man to be your father's "Guide" and accompany him on his inspections.
Your father left you to take care of [Zheng Hanzhen], so you lived in the "Bajia" temporarily and met [Falcon], the son of [Ba Mansion Mountain], and [Gan Ma] (she who came to the "Bajia" once to deliver medicine. She is the sister of the "Wizard" in the village, and she smells very good).
[Falcon] is a great young man. He is strong and likes hunting. He knows that you are bored in the house, so he will take you out to climb the hills in the west of the village and look at the sea of ​​red flowers in "Xiya" - [Falcon] He also shook the "bell" he carried with him and sang to you: "Little girl, listen to me ask (eh), who is the good hunter on the ground (eh)? Come and follow me when I sing folk songs (eh), my brother is handsome and a good hunter (eh) ..." You also wanted to sing in reply, but you couldn't sing to each other, so you could only nod. Then you find [Gan Ma] and want to learn songs from her - [Gan Ma] often sings a "Mountain Spirit Song". Although you didn't learn it, you heard [Gan Ma] tell the story of "Mountain Spirit".
A long time ago, "Mountain Spirit" and "Wizard" lived a peaceful life. One day, a "robber" broke into the "Mountain Spirit Cave", tied up "Mountain Spirit" and took him away. "Mountain Spirit" did not want to leave. Seeing that the "Mountain Spirit" could not be taken away, the "robber" pulled out a short knife and stabbed it... After the "Mountain Spirit" was stabbed, it fell into the river, and the blood that flowed out dyed the flowers on the mountain red. ·······From then on, the "Mountain Spirit" began to hate people and lured people who broke into "Xiya" to their deaths.
On the second day of the seventh lunar month, your father completed the inspection on the south bank of the "Ying River" and took you and [Zheng Hanzhen] who had recovered back to the "Inn" hotel, and asked [Zheng Hanzhen], who was not suitable for field work, to send the previous inspection report to you. Return to Wuhan. After that, your father took you to the northeastern mountainous area of ​​"Jilingping" (from the "Inn" to the east of "Jiling Tower", climb over the mountain and go back and forth every day).
On the 18th day of the seventh lunar month, [Zheng Hanzhen] returns to "Jilingping" and comes to the "Inn" to meet you. At this time, my father also wanted to go to "Xiya" for inspection - you suddenly became worried, fearing that as [Gan Ma] said, there was a "Mountain Spirit" in the "Mountain Spirit Cave" there, which would lure people to death... ···
Because the land of "Xiya" belongs to the "Ba Family", [Zheng Hanzhen] took the initiative to seek permission from [Ba Mansion Mountain] on your father's behalf. You wanted to see [Falcon], so you went to "Ba Kang" with [Zheng Hanzhen] Village" - [Ba Mansion Mountain], which had always supported your father's work before, went against the norm and said that there was a dangerous "Mountain Spirit" in "Xiya" and prohibited inspection... Although no consent was obtained, you took the opportunity to see [Falcon 】, and quietly told him that he would go to "Jiling Pagoda" every day (you are very familiar with this road and can go without telling your father)...
After that, your father went to the "Bajia" to beg for help several times, but was rejected every time. He wanted to go directly from "Dongya", but was blocked by the young farmhand [Li Demu] from the "Bajia". Just when your father was trying to find a way When we were about to pass through "Bakang Village" to "Xiya" from the other side, a tragedy quietly began...
Since you told [Falcon] that you would go to the "Sister Tower", he would come every morning and carry a bow and arrow rope, and run to the "Sister Tower" to see you - you stayed in the tower until the afternoon, spending time A short good time, and then [Falcon] will send you back to the "Inn".
On the 27th day of the seventh lunar month, you went to the "Jiling Pagoda" early in the morning. Because you came early, you walked up to the tower to wait for [Falcon], but saw that [Li Demu] was also on the tower - he was hiding in the shadows of the tower. You were startled and couldn't help but scream. , [Li Demu] heard it and rushed towards you with red eyes!
You were so frightened that you turned around and ran down the tower, with [Li Demu] chasing after you. You are a girl after all, and you ran out of energy when you ran into the woods near the "Wooden Bridge" in "Xiya". [Li Demu] He catches up and grabs your shoulders, puts his thumb on your throat, shakes you hard, and mumbles: "Mountain Spirit... stay with me... Things, don’t tell others..."
You felt it was difficult to breathe, so you grabbed [Li Demu]'s hand and struggled - at this extremely critical moment, [Li Demu]'s hands suddenly lost strength. After you broke away, you saw that [Falcon] was holding him from behind. [Li Demu]'s neck... [Falcon] strangled him until [Li Demu] stopped struggling before letting him go - [Li Demu] then fell to the ground, not breathing!
【Falcon】Let you go back first. You were grateful to [Falcon] for saving you, but you were also frightened and hurried back to the "Inn". Later, you heard that [Li Demu] was found hanging from a tree beside "Xiya". Some people said that he was He was possessed and committed suicide because of seeing the "Mountain Spirit"... You trembled when you heard it, but your father didn't believe this kind of thing and still wanted to go to "Xiya" to find out.
On the 28th day of the seventh lunar month, you did not go to the "Jiling Pagoda" again because of fear.
On the twenty-ninth day of the seventh lunar month, you found that your father was missing in the morning, so you went to [Zheng Hanzhen]'s room to look for him. Later, you did not find your father in the "Inn" - you were worried that your father had gone to "Xiya", and you thought The appearance of "Mountain Spirit" and [Li Demu] that day made you more and more scared, so you had to ask [Zheng Hanzhen], who was not physically strong but was cautious and knowledgeable, to go outside with you to look for him. You also told him that your father might dangerous!
According to the route that your father may take, first take [Zheng Hanzhen] from the east side of "Jiling Pagoda" over the mountain to "Dongya", then cross the bridge and find "Xiya" all the way (because Li Demu is dead and there is no one obstruction), and finally walked into the "Mountain Spirit Cave" - ​​the cave is very deep, the light inside is dim, the smell is unpleasant, there is an unburned candle on the stone table near the entrance of the cave - your father is sitting at the table, holding a candle in his hand A "dagger" that seemed to be in his luggage (you remember it was engraved on it), lowered his head and murmured: "Mountain Spirit...I, Zhou Yuntang, finally saw...I I will never forget you..."
You and [Zheng Hanzhen] called for him, but your father just raised his head and had no other reaction. You were afraid that your father was really possessed, so you gritted your teeth and said to go find the "Wizard" to save people, and let [Zheng Hanzhen] watch your father in the cave.
After you come out of the cave, because you don't know the way to "Bakang Village" from here, you can only find the direction, run south along the "Eagle River" back to "Bakang Village", and go to the "Wizard's House" (Linhe When I met [Gan Ma] while walking on a hanging "diaojiaolou"), she said that her brother went to "Bajia". You rushed to the "Bajia" again, asked [Falcon], and learned that the "Wizard" and [Falcon]'s father went to the "Old Wooden House" together...
You were helpless, so you hugged [Falcon] tightly and asked him if "Mountain Spirit" would harm your father? [Falcon] closed his mouth tightly and you could feel him trembling.
At this time, [Falcon]'s mother came out to ask about the situation. After hearing you explain your father's situation in detail, she said with a pale face: "This is indeed Mountain Spirit... Bring him back quickly, I have a solution save him!"
[Falcon] will immediately take you around the "cemetery" from the north and return to the "Mountain Spirit Cave", only to find that there is no one in the cave - both [Zheng Hanzhen] and your father are missing! [Falcon] Let you stay here while he goes to find someone.
After [Falcon] left, you looked around, and finally saw a "figure" passing by in the flowers beside the "Eagle River" south of the "Mountain Spirit Cave" - ​​you hurried over, and when you got there, you saw your father Lying on the ground, there are many wounds on the body, and the blood that flows out is soaked in a large piece of red flowers. The person has died long ago, but there is a smile on his face... You kneel on the ground and scream, crying and shouting Father, I hope he can wake up. Until [Zheng Hanzhen] finds you, you still can’t accept the fact...
You can’t remember how long you cried until you saw [Ba Mansion Mountain] and a “Man in Black Robe” passing by carrying a covered coffin. [Zheng Hanzhen] went to talk to them and helped them carry away the coffin, and then “ The servants of the "Bajia" came back with [Zheng Hanzhen] and restrained your father. Because your father had nothing to do with the village, he was sent to the "Jiling Pagoda" to have his soul laid to rest... Later [Zheng Hanzhen] Hanzhen] will accompany you back to the "Inn" hotel and let you rest while he goes outside to inquire about news.
[Falcon] came to see you, but you kept crying and could not speak, so he stayed with you silently until dark before leaving. Before leaving, [Falcon] gave you a "red leather scabbard".
On the 30th day of the seventh lunar month, you had calmed down your grief a little. [Zheng Hanzhen] hired a car at the "Inn" to take your father's bones back to Yichang. Because of the hot weather, they were buried soon after the autopsy...
[Zheng Hanzhen] After attending your father's funeral, he will return to Wuhan. Before he leaves, he tells you not to go to "Jilingping" again - there are no good people in that place! Your brother [Zhou Jingyu] came back after your father's funeral and listened to your explanation. After that, according to custom, you and your brother stayed at home for three years.

This year (1914), in June, your brother left home. In September, your brother hasn’t come back yet. Only then did your mother tell you that she sent your brother to Wuhan - it turns out that your father and [Zheng Hanzhen]'s father were not only good friends, but they also agreed before you and [Zheng Hanzhen] were born to be in-laws, but it never happened. I told you - now that your filial piety period has expired, your mother asked your brother to ask when the "Zheng family" will come to hire you. If you don't have this intention, your mother will find your husband's family.
You knew your brother's whereabouts, so you left home and went to Wuhan to find him - you found the "Zheng family", met your father's friend "Zheng Changmin" (Zheng Hanzhen's father), heard that your brother had indeed come to visit, and thought I matched you with [Zheng Hanzhen], but you didn’t see [Zheng Hanzhen] (Zheng Hanzhen was not at home because of a meeting at the time). Your brother only stayed at "Zheng's house" for one night and then left without saying where he was going.
"Zheng Changmin" and his wife like you very much, asked your zodiac sign, gave you a "Weiyang Seal", one of the twelve zodiac signs, and hoped that you could stay for a few more days and wait for them. My son [Zheng Hanzhen] came back from a business trip. You are worried about your brother. Remembering that during his mourning period, he kept saying that he wanted to investigate the truth behind his father's murder and find out the true identity of "Mountain Spirit". You guessed that he might have gone to "Jilingping".
You then said goodbye and left the "Zheng family", preparing to go to "Jilingping" to find your brother - you have not forgotten the [Gan Ma] you met at the beginning. You remember that when you were learning songs from her, you promised to give her a "foreigner's thing" "As a thank you gift, I bought a bottle of old "red wine" in Wuhan.
Yesterday (September 15th), in the morning, you came to "Jilingping" again and stayed in the "Xuanzi Room" of the "Yizhan" hotel. I remembered that [Zheng Hanzhen] took you to leave "Jilingping" in a hurry. I left my father's luggage at the "Inn" hotel, so I asked the owner of the hotel. The owner said that it happened a few years ago and that the things were all stored in the warehouse and he needed time to find them.
In the afternoon, you take the "red wine" you bought from Wuhan and go to the "Wizard's House" to find [Gan Ma]. [Gan Ma] I was very surprised to see you and insisted that you stay overnight, so you had no choice but to agree. [Gan Ma] First arrange a place for you, and then she will drag you to the house where she lives to talk. You gave "red wine" to [Gan Ma], she brought two bowls, you each drank a bowl, your face soon became hot - I don't know if it was because of drinking, but you suddenly wanted to go there "Bajia" (you really want to meet Falcon). [Gan Ma] After sending you outside the "Bajia" door, she blushed and said that she had something to do in the afternoon and agreed to pick you up here later.
You walked into the gate of the "Ba Family" and said you were looking for [Falcon]. The servants of the "Ba Family" said that the "young village master" had gone out and didn't know when he would be back. You had no choice but to say goodbye, walked out of "Bakang Village" from the west gate, climbed up the hill, and looked at "Xiya". What you saw was not the sea of ​​​​flaming red flowers, but a piece of scorched earth after the fire...alcohol amplified it. Your emotions make you even more frustrated and even sleepy. You find a suitable tree and sleep against it for a while. When you wake up, it's already dusk.
When you return to the door of "Bajia", a woman wearing a "mask" comes over. She is wearing the clothes that [Gan Ma] wore when she met you before. When she speaks, you can hear [Gan Ma]'s voice and also Smell the familiar aroma - [Gan Ma] explains that this is her brother's request, and then she takes you back to the "Wizard's house".
[Gan Ma] will send you to the second floor of the east side house that has been cleaned up for you (located on the east side of the main house of "Wizard's House", with the "Tiger River" outside the window). You put down your bag and [Gan Ma] went out to get you a dinner.
After you finish eating alone, chat with [Gan Ma] who is still wearing a "mask" and learn that she has received the bride price and is about to get married - the other party is [Falcon], the son of [Ba Mansion Mountain], but she I don’t know each other - you heard that [Gan Ma]’s “fiancé” turned out to be someone you like, and you suddenly felt mixed emotions in your heart...
You were unwilling to accept it, but you still showed that you were happy for [Gan Ma]. Later, you said that you came to "Jilingping" to see the places where your father had been...
Today (September 16th), [Gan Ma] came to see you in the morning. She is still wearing a "mask" and her fragrance is stronger. If you want to go to "Bajia" again, [Gan Ma] will accompany you. go.
After you and [Gan Ma] went out, you saw [Falcon] and [Zheng Hanzhen] at the same time in the village. They were with a man (Li Gaobai). At this time, [Gan Ma] called out to a man carrying a "back basket" Woman (Ruya), those three men also noticed you...


The story after the pleasantries
Everyone accepted the invitation of [Falcon] and came to the "hall" of "Bajia" to dine. There was homemade "rice wine" at the table - [Gan Ma] never took off his "mask" and never ate or drank. -[Ba Mansion Mountain] is not at home. I heard someone said that he and "Wizard" [Gui Yin] went out early in the morning.
After finishing the meal, the servants cleared the table and served tea. At this time, you heard [Ba Mansion Mountain] and another man talking while returning to "Ba's House". They continued talking outside the "hall" door - you I vaguely heard [Ba Mansion Mountain] ask: "...Who is it?" The man said: "I guess... this person was there back then..." [Ba Mansion Mountain] Then he said: "If that's the case, I will go to the "old wooden house"..." The man lowered his voice: "...the one closest to the river..." [Ba Mansion Mountain 】Said fiercely: "If it is true...I can't forgive..." The man said: "I will go back and use the divination first to confirm...and then bring the incense." .....”
[Falcon] opens the door and goes out at this time, and the conversation outside immediately stops - because when you open the door, you see [Ba Mansion Mountain] and a "Man in Black Robe" outside the door, both of them are very dirty... "Man in Black Robe" said goodbye to [Ba Mansion Mountain], [Ruya] took [Gan Ma] and "Man in Black Robe" home, and [Gan Ma] pulled you and left together (you guessed "Man in Black Robe" "That's Gan Ma's brother - "Wizard" Gui Yin).
You finally reunited with [Falcon], but you didn’t even have a chance to be alone. [Gan Ma] pulled you, and you had to leave with her - [Falcon] and [Gan Ma] were engaged, and you couldn’t do it no matter what. Let her or her family know about you and [Falcon]!
At about 13:00 in the afternoon, you returned to the "Wizard's House". [Ruya] put down the "basket" covered with "flower cloth" at the door of the main house, and went upstairs with "Man in Black Robe". [Gan Ma] took you to the second floor of the east side house where you lived, but didn't say anything - you couldn't see [Gan Ma]'s expression behind the "mask", and you felt uneasy, feeling that the weather was very hot, so Open the window to make the room cooler, then smile and wait for [Gan Ma] to speak first. [Gan Ma] suddenly turned around and ran out, which surprised you, but you didn't dare to follow her (you were afraid she would notice something).
After a while, a gourd-shaped "bell" was thrown out of the window, and then you heard someone calling you softly outside - you poked your head out and saw [Falcon] standing on a small boat (the bow of the boat was tied to the east side of the house with its bow facing west). On the west pillar of the north, the hull faces the window of the east side room, waving to you constantly - at this time you vaguely heard someone arguing with [Gui Yin] on the "terrace" on the second floor of the main house, mentioning "return" "Hunxiang", [Gui Yin] didn't agree and got angry. Then something fell down... But you only have [Falcon] in your eyes at the moment!
You ran out of the house and went downstairs, opened the window from the first floor, climbed out, and jumped onto the boat - [Falcon] hugged you immediately, but the boat under your feet obviously couldn't help being so turbulent, and it swayed under the force... Neither you nor [Falcon] could stand firm and fell into the river together - you were afraid that the "Wizard Family" would see you, so you dived into the water and swam hard in the direction of the "Sisters' Tower"... ··When you swam far away, you dared to come out of the water to take a breath. When you saw [Falcon] in front of you, you immediately swam to him, looked at your long-lost lover, and laughed.
[Falcon] looked happy and took you to swim forward - you were like two happy fish, playing in the blue waves of the "Tiger River" - you quickly swam past the "Sister Tower", you were a little tired I climbed up the river bank on the "Dongya" side, but didn't see [Falcon].
You were a little anxious, looking towards the river, and suddenly saw a familiar "figure" passing by in the woods on the opposite river bank - that was the place where [Falcon] strangled [Li Demu] back then!
At this time, [Falcon] suddenly pops out of the river and scares you!
[Falcon] You laughed loudly in the water, but you felt uneasy because of the "figure". When you looked again, the "figure" was gone - you suddenly felt that the "figure" was like what you saw before you saw your father's body. The same! [Falcon] climbed ashore at this time, held you in his arms and told jokes. You were thinking about the "figure" you just saw and couldn't laugh.
You told [Falcon] that you are wet now, how can you go back to see people? [Falcon] said not to worry, he would go home and bring you some clean clothes right away - you urged [Falcon] to go back quickly, and he ran along the river bank in the direction of "Bakang Village".
You then rested on the shore and saw a "wooden box" on the opposite bank from a distance. It seemed to be floating along the current... At this time, several farmhands came from the "old wooden house" in the distance. " Walking this way, you guessed that it's almost time for them to go to "Dongya" to work - naturally you don't want a few men to see your "drowned" appearance, so you hurried to "Dongya" "Run to the depths - you and your father have been there before, and you remember that it was all wasteland, and there were very few farm laborers there.
You ran to the depths of "Dongya" and saw a corpse on the ground - the face of the deceased was very familiar to you, it was your brother [Zhou Jingyu]! He was lying on the ground with many wounds on his body. The blood that flowed out was soaked in a large piece of red flower. It had long solidified and was no longer bright red. Your brother had died long ago, but there was a smile on his face...
This familiar scene made your mind go blank and you were stunned in place. After a while, you felt the huge grief and couldn't care about anything else. You just wanted to find [Falcon]! You turned around and ran back, panicking and running across the "wooden bridge" in one breath. When you crossed the bridge, you saw a small boat in the "Tiger River" with no one on it. After crossing the bridge, you saw a boat near the shore. There are "rice wine" and "oil daddy" on the ground, as if worshiping the dead. You run to "Xiya" and see the scorched earth after the fire from a close distance. You feel even more frightened and want to find someone you know in this strange place.
You saw a person wearing a "mask" running behind the mountain in the distance - you didn't see it clearly, but since he was wearing a "mask", it must be [Gan Ma] - you quickly chased after him, but you didn't expect the mountain's There is actually a "cemetery" behind it!
Fortunately, it is still daytime, and you remember that passing through the "cemetery" is the "Bakang Village", so you continue to walk forward, and finally see the other people - [Ruya] and [Gan] who is wearing a "mask" and wet clothes. Ma] stood in front of an dug grave, and [Li Gaobai] stood opposite. You caught a glimpse of the words "Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)" on the tombstone on the side.
[Zheng Hanzhen] and [Falcon], who were covered in mud and water, were holding a coffin lid together. Between them was the coffin that was originally buried in the ground. You subconsciously looked at the "thin board coffin" and saw a partially rotted body inside. The male corpse’s face is vaguely visible!
You didn't want to look any further, but you felt that the corpse looked familiar - you looked at the face of the male corpse again, and after confirming it, you shouted with a trembling voice: "The person inside... is Li Demu!"
You recognized the body of [Li Demu] and finally calmed down, thinking that there were too many stories in "Bakang Village" that concealed the truth - your brother and father were killed in similar ways. I don't know if it was a coincidence or " "Curse" - After your father was killed, [Ba Mansion Mountain] took over everything with the servants of the "Ba family", and the truth has not been found out yet... Now that your brother is also dead, you can't help but worry about this time If this is revealed, someone will immediately notify [Ba Mansion Mountain] and everything will be under control again...
You begin to doubt other people, and everyone you once knew has changed - you don't even know that you can still trust [Falcon] who is engaged to [Gan Ma] and comes to you again!
You grit your teeth and make up your mind. This time you will temporarily hide the fact that your brother has been killed, investigate secretly, and find the truth (you will not tell this until you discover the truth)!


next story
At about 16:30, everyone returned to "Bakang Village" and saw "Grandma" playing with her grandson on the roadside. She sang a song belonging to "Ghost Moon" (the seventh month of the lunar calendar). : "Don't go into the water before and after the Zhongyuan Dynasty (yo), if you drown, you will find a scapegoat (yo); don't sleep under a tree in July (yo), if you hang yourself, you will find a scapegoat (yo)..."
Even though you were under the sun, you couldn't help but shiver - you hadn't had time to change clothes before, and you were still wet.
[Gan Ma] took you back to the door of "Wizard's House", but when you came to stay yesterday, you only brought a carry-on bag (it contained some belongings, which you left in the east room after you went downstairs and jumped out of the window) , I didn’t bring my luggage, so I said I would go back to the "inn" to get something (change of clothes). [Gan Ma] was very reluctant and told you to come back and stay today.
You ran back to the "Inn" hotel and changed into clean clothes in the "Xuanzi Room" - you have been scared after seeing your brother's body - but you can't escape, you must find out the truth for your murdered relatives!
At about 17:00, you leave the "Inn" and walk back to "Bakang Village".
You kept thinking about the cause of death of your father and your brother on the road, trying to find out the connection between the two murders... You remember that after your father's body returned to your hometown, before it was buried, the family invited the widow to do an autopsy. It turns out that there were 6 stab wounds on my father’s body, varying in depth, 2 of which were deep (fatal wounds). Judging from the wounds, the murder weapon was probably a "dagger" (the blade was about 15cmx3cm) - the wounds on your brother's body seemed to be similar to Your father's is very similar... You suddenly thought that your brother might have used a "fake name" to investigate, so no one in the village has heard of [Zhou Jingyu]!
When you are about to reach the "Stone Bridge", you see [Gan Ma] wearing a "mask" running across the bridge from the north side and running back to "Bakang Village". You then returned to "Bakang Village". Before you reached the "Wizard's House", you saw [Ruya], [Li Gaobai], [Falcon] and [Zheng Hanzhen] who had changed into clean clothes and brought several "Ba Kangzhai". The servants of "Wizard's House" were outside the door of "Wizard's House", [Gan Ma] wearing a "mask" shouted in front of them, and then ran into the main house of "Wizard's House" - everyone else followed [Gan Ma] in - You quickly run over and after entering the main house, you see everyone going up the stairs on the west side to the second floor.
When you go up the stairs, you see [Gan Ma] banging on the door of the "quiet room" hard, but it can't be opened because of the latch inside.
[Falcon] held [Gan Ma], let several servants bump into it, and finally broke the door open (you have gone upstairs and are at the back of the crowd) - There is no one in the "Quiet Room", and there are some things scattered on the ground - [Gan Ma] ran to the "terrace" first, and everyone followed her (you also ran to the "terrace") and saw a "rope" tied to the east railing, as if something was hanging outside... ···Already had a premonition that something was going on, and wanted to get closer to [Falcon], but saw him hugging [Gan Ma], both of them trembling - [Li Gaobai] ran to the "railing", looked down, and then Shouted: "It's Gui Yin!"
[Ruya] shouted in shock: "Pull him up quickly!"
[Zheng Hanzhen] immediately went over and worked with [Li Gaobai] to pull up the "rope" and pulled the body with the "rope" tightly around the neck out of the "terrace" and placed it flat on the "terrace" - the deceased It's the "Man in Black Robe" (Gui Yin) I've seen before!
The sun has not set yet, but you suddenly feel a chill... Maybe [Gui Yin] is not the only one who died today...
