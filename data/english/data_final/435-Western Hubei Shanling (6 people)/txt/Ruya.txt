story background
September 16, 1914 (the third year of the Republic of China)
As early as the late Qing Dynasty, someone proposed to build a "Sichuan-Hankou Railway" connecting Hubei and Sichuan provinces and running through the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River. After that, private funds were raised to establish a railway company to conduct surveys along the route in Hubei.
In the second year of Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty (1910), a professor came to "Jilingping" in western Hubei to inspect the landforms. The manager there was the owner of the "Bakang Village" who owned a large area of ​​land and the "Mountain Spirit" who had been worshiping the "Mountain Spirit" for generations. The "Wizard" who controls life and death.
In June of the third year of the Republic of China (1914), after Zhan Tianyou served as the "Han-Yue-Sichuan Railway Supervisor" of the Ministry of Transportation of the Beiyang Government, he formed a survey team and separately conducted a re-survey of the section from Hubei to Sichuan. In August, a young expert and his assistant came to "Jilingping" for inspection. I don't know what the result will be this time...
your story
Your surname is "Miao" and your name is [Ruya]. You were born in the 18th year of Guangxu's reign in the Qing Dynasty (1892). Your zodiac sign is Dragon and you are from Hubei and western Hubei. Your mother "Tian Shi" died young, and your father [Miao Na] was the "Wizard" who worshiped the "Mountain Spirit" in the "Bakang Village" for generations, and taught you how to read since you were a child. Your father's sister [Miao Shi] (your aunt) married the big landowner [Ba Mansion Mountain] of "Sister Lingping" (also the owner of "Bakang Village") and gave birth to two children, namely Bi Your cousin [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] who is 1 year younger than you and your cousin [Falcon] who is 3 years younger than you.
You often see your father praying for the "Mountain Spirit" for people who sincerely pray to help them relieve their pain... Your father has told you since you were a child that the "Mountain Spirit" has taboos (such as murder and arson, adultery between men and women, and theft of gods). or things belonging to the dead, are taboo, those who violate taboos must sacrifice their lives to be forgiven. The "Wizard" in the past dynasties has always been supervising "Sister Lingping" on behalf of "Mountain Spirit"... This is "Sister Lingping" The rules of "Ping" are more important in everyone's hearts than the king's law.
In the late summer when you were 10 years old (1901), you went to "Xiya" to deliver meals to your father who was "retreating" in the "Mountain Spirit Cave". You saw a young farmhand holding a girl who had died. He knelt on the ground and kowtowed vigorously, saying that it was all his fault and begging "Mountain Spirit" to spare his sister. He was willing to die on her behalf!
After you return to "Bakang Village", tell your aunt about this. Your aunt took pity on the brother and sister, so she bought a "thin board coffin", took people to move outside the cave, picked up the girl's body and put it in, but the girl's brother was still there. Kneel down outside the "Mountain Spirit Cave" and beg... Auntie relents and takes the boy into the cave to find your father.
You then follow up and listen to your father asking the boy if he is willing to pay his "life" as a "price" in exchange for forgiveness? After receiving a positive answer, your aunt asked someone to carry the coffin into the "Mountain Spirit Cave". Your father lit "resurrection incense" around the coffin and taught the boy the spell to pray to the "Mountain Spirit".
Afterwards, your father sent your aunt and others away from the "Mountain Spirit Cave", and you stayed to help the boy watch the candles and "resurrection incense" in the cave. Take out some (continued).
The boy's constant prayers finally moved the "Mountain Spirit" and called the departed soul back to the world... There was a sound in the "thin board coffin", and the boy climbed over desperately. When he saw his resurrected sister, he just screamed After saying her name [Gan Ma], she fell to the ground and fell unconscious... You helped [Gan Ma] out of the coffin, explained the whole story to her, and took her back to your "diaojiaolou" ( Wizard's house) rest.
Later, the boy was rescued by your father and became his apprentice. He changed his name to [Gui Yin] and swore to serve the "Mountain Spirit" throughout his life. From then on, [Gui Yin] and [Gan Ma] both lived in your house.
When you were 12 years old (1903), your father passed away - before his death, he asked [Gui Yin] to wear a "black robe" symbolizing the identity of the "Wizard", inherit everything from him, and become the new "Wizard" of "Bakang Village" ". That year you were immersed in the pain of losing your father. Although [Gui Yin] took care of you, he couldn't comfort you. [Gan Ma] was too young to help you.
The following year (1904), the outside "three brothers of the Li family" were hired by [Ba Mansion Mountain] to cultivate the land of "Dongya". [Gui Yin] took some amulets and gave them to the "old wooden house" where the farm laborers lived. You also went there and got to know the eldest brother [Li Demu], the second brother [Li Liangsong] and the third brother [Li Gaobai] of the "Three Brothers of the Li Family" - they are all young and very enthusiastic towards you, [Li Demu] later You also come to the "Wizard's House" in the village to give him local products from his hometown Hefeng as a return gift - after going back and forth like this, you and [Li Demu] will become familiar with each other, and you often go to the "old wooden house" to play with him.
After knowing each other for a long time, you learned that [Li Demu] really wanted his third brother to study, but he had no money. At that time, the village hired a Private Tutor to teach his cousin [Falcon] and the children in the village. You introduced [Li Gaobai] to [Falcon] as a reading companion and entered a private school without spending money. You also recommended [Li Gaobai] to study in the village. In my spare time, I come to the "Wizard's House" (a suspended "stilted building" on the side of the river) to do odd jobs, earn some money, and help [Li Demu] share her worries.
[Li Gaobai] is 2 years younger than you. You often take care of him in the village. You repeatedly tell your cousin not to bully him. When the weather is bad, you leave him to stay at the "Wizard's house". [Gan Ma] welcomes this very much The boy also said that [Li Gaobai] promised to be her friend... [Li Demu] I am very grateful to you. You also like to tell your concerns to this "brother" who is 5 years older than you, and his The relationship is getting better and better - your aunt [Miao Shi] and cousin [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] both think that a good man should be educated and knowledgeable, while you like men to be kind and take care of others.
When you were 19 years old (1910), you began secretly dating [Li Demu] (according to the rules, your marriage must be arranged by your elders, but they could not agree to your marrying a farmhand). In order to avoid being seen, you took him with you. The "Mountain Spirit Cave" in "Xiya" (the "Wizard" only stays in the cave for "retreat" at the end of summer every year, or on special days such as autumn festivals, etc., and does not usually go there - although the air in the cave is not good, No one dares to break in).
You bring the home-brewed "rice wine" and hand-made "oil cake" sent by "Bajia" every year for [Li Demu] to eat, and he always leaves some to take back to his brothers. You can see that [Li Demu] cares about his younger brothers, and you also know that he has been worried about his third brother's studies - [Li Gaobai] after completing his studies at the private school, he still wants to go to the provincial capital to study, which [Li Demu] simply cannot afford tuition fee.
You really want to help, but you can't come up with a way - your father didn't leave much savings when he passed away, and although your uncle [Ba Mansion Mountain] has money, he will never lend it to outsiders...his uncle had promised to give it to outsiders before. Daughter [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] married [Gui Yin], and the wedding date was set not long ago. [Gui Yin] started to prepare for the wedding, which is the time to spend money.
In the sixth month of the lunar calendar, [Li Gaobai] was called to work by [Ba Mansion Mountain] and temporarily left the "Wizard's house".
On the second day of the seventh lunar month, [Li Gaobai] returned to the "Wizard's house" to continue working.
Two days later (the fourth day of the seventh lunar month), you and [Li Demu] were having a tryst in the "Mountain Spirit Cave" and suddenly heard someone talking outside. After passing Gan Ma, he stayed in the cave later) and closed the coffin lid. Then [Gui Yin] took [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] into the cave, and you walked out alone without them becoming suspicious. Later you met [Li Demu], and he said that he hid until the two people left and then came out without being discovered.
After that, [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] came to go out with [Gui Yin] almost every day, because they might enter the "Mountain Spirit Cave", so you and [Li Demu] had to go to the "Sisters Tower" for a tryst instead (later Li Demu, because his second brother has left "Sisters Lingping" temporarily and he has to do an extra job, you can only meet after dusk).
【Li Demu】At that time, he was always distracted and cared less and less about you. Although you knew that he was troubled and depressed because of his third brother's schooling, you were still unhappy.
On the 22nd day of the seventh lunar month, you quarreled with [Li Demu] for the first time on the pagoda, so you were so angry that you didn't go to the "Jiling Pagoda" to see him for several days. You took the opportunity to go to the "Ba Family" to visit the person you were about to marry. The cousin of "Wizard's family" [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] saw her haggard face, so he asked her to chat, and accidentally expressed his dissatisfaction with [Li Demu]. [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] was very happy after hearing this I sympathized with you, promised to keep it a secret, and would never tell anyone else until I died - you didn't expect that what followed would be an eternal farewell to these two people!
On the 27th day of the seventh lunar month, you saw [Gan Ma] go to the "Quiet Room" on the second floor of the "Wizard's House" to hide a "rope" with brown traces, and then you heard that "Li Demu" was hanged in the In the woods near the "Wooden Bridge" in "Xiya", someone said that he was possessed and committed suicide after seeing the "Mountain Spirit"!
When you know the news, [Li Demu] has been put into a coffin and sent to the east entrance of the "cemetery" to be laid to rest... You can't believe this is true - even if you go secretly I walked outside the east entrance of the "cemetery" and saw the corpse in the coffin with my own eyes. I still couldn't accept it!
On the 28th day of the seventh lunar month, you felt sad and regretful about the previous quarrel. After sitting on the second floor of the east side house where you lived for a day, you finally remembered that your father had used the "resurrection incense" to revive [Gan Ma] - you were then After witnessing the whole process, I believe that I can use the same method to resurrect [Li Demu] - the "resurrection incense" has been hidden in the "Mountain Spirit Cave", it is very precious, [Gui Yin] cannot help you, you have to do it yourself Think of ways to.
On the 29th day of the seventh lunar month, you didn't sleep well at all. You got up early and went out to "Xiya". From a distance, you saw a figure walking into the "Mountain Spirit Cave". You were afraid of being seen, so you hid outside the cave. I wanted to wait until the people inside left before going in. After a while, you heard a burst of trembling laughter and conversation. A man stumbled out of the cave. There were still people talking in the cave... Then someone entered the cave again, calling something in different voices. (You didn’t even hear it clearly).
You hide for a while longer and hear someone leaving again. You waited for the footsteps to disappear, then quietly walked outside the cave and looked inside - you saw a man with his back to you, and a [Middle-Aged Man] sitting at the stone table opposite - [Middle-Aged Man] was looking out of the cave when he suddenly shouted excitedly: "You're back!"
You immediately ducked and turned around to see there was no one around! [Middle-Aged Man] then rushes out of the "Mountain Spirit Cave" holding a "dagger", shouting: "This is yours...it's yours, why don't you want it anymore?" while running towards you. ! You were frightened and ran south on your hands and knees, with [Middle-Aged Man] chasing after you - you vaguely heard a scream like [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)], but you didn't dare to stop. .
You run to the "Eagle River" south of the "Mountain Spirit Cave" and are caught up by the [Middle-Aged Man]. He grabs you hard and puts the "dagger" into your hand - look at the handle of the "dagger" Inlaid with rubies and engraved on the blade, I recognized it as something my father had placed in the "Mountain Spirit Cave" during his lifetime. I heard that an "unbreakable death curse" had been placed on it!
You were so scared at the moment that you stabbed [Middle-Aged Man] with the "dagger" - [Middle-Aged Man] did not dodge and laughed after being stabbed into the body by the "dagger", as if he was possessed - you pulled out the "dagger" ", a stream of blood spurted onto your face, but [Middle-Aged Man] held you tighter! You gritted your teeth and stabbed him a few more times until he fell down with you and couldn't get up anymore.
You broke away from [Middle-Aged Man], the blue clothes on your body were stained with blood - [Middle-Aged Man] was lying on the ground, the blood from the wound soaked the flowers, the man was dead, his face But you still smiled... I don’t know how long it took before you realized from the panic that you had killed someone!
You didn't dare to leave the murder weapon, so you grabbed the "dagger", got up on your hands and knees, and fled further away - because you were so panicked, you used your last strength to run into the "cemetery", and you were so weak that you had to hide. After arriving at a remote grave mound, I couldn't help but close my eyes. I just wanted to take a rest, but before I knew it, I fell into a deep sleep... Even though I heard something in my dream, I didn't wake up.
When you opened your eyes, it was already dark and the blood on your face and body had solidified. At this moment, you suddenly hear a "crunching" sound... You wait for the sound to disappear, then stick your head out, look through the moonlight, and see a "thin coffin" with the lid opened not far away. It looked familiar. There was a corner of a sleeve hanging on the side wall of the coffin. There was no one nearby. You were only wearing one piece of clothing and it was stained with blood. You couldn't go home like this, so you bent over and ran to the thin coffin. You saw that there was only one piece of clothing inside. A woman's "embroidered wedding dress" with sleeves hanging on the side wall of the coffin.
When you see this dress, you immediately take off your blood-stained clothes, bunch them up and throw them into the coffin. Then, by the moonlight, you bend down to pick up the "embroidered wedding dress" - only then do you notice the "embroidered wedding dress." It's broken at the heart, and there's blood and a smell - but it's still much better than the one you took off.
After you put on the "embroidered wedding dress", grab the "dagger", return to "Xiya" by the moonlight from the way you came in, and then go back to "Bakang Village" (according to customs) by going around the "cemetery" on the mountain road to the north. It is unlucky to pass through the "cemetery", so people generally take a detour between the two mountains to the north of the "cemetery"). When you reach the "Tiger River", go to the water to wash your face.
At this time, you see a staggering figure coming to the river, walking straight into the river, and then being washed away by the water... You watch the figure disappear into the dark river, panic in your heart, and speed up I continued to walk towards "Bakang Village", but saw two people at the east entrance of the "cemetery" from a distance (from the north of the "cemetery" back to the west gate of the village, you must pass through the east entrance of the "cemetery") , you are afraid of being seen by them, so you dare not go there.
Soon, many people holding torches came out from the west gate of the village, went to the "cemetery" and then walked south - you waited for the two people to kneel down and bowed their heads facing the "cemetery", and then ran into the village in the dark and went home - you After returning to her residence, she immediately changed her clothes and hid the "embroidered wedding dress" and "dagger" she took off in a "wooden box" left by her mother.
On the morning of the next day (the 30th day of the seventh lunar month), [Gan Ma] came to you and said that your aunt [Miao Shi] drowned... You heard the bad news and barely managed to hold on without falling, and then [Gan Ma] Tell you that [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] committed suicide and held a funeral in the "cemetery"... You can't remember anything else, only remember waiting for you to rush to the "cemetery" "At that time, [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] had been buried - the coffin with [Li Demu]'s body parked at the entrance of the "cemetery" also got up early that day and was taken back to his hometown in a carriage hired by his brothers. A week later, [Ba Mansion Mountain] held a funeral for [Miao Shi] and buried her in the "Bajia" cemetery.
The next year (1911), your uncle arranged for you to marry [Gui Yin], who was 8 years older than you. At this time, you still couldn't forget the person you once liked, so you borrowed the custom of "crying marriage" in the village to get married. Cry a lot before. 【Gui Yin】I have known you for a long time. After marriage, our life has been the same as before and we have no children. [Gan Ma] started to learn some things from [Gui Yin] at this time, applying spices every day, sometimes wearing the "mask" given to her by [Gui Yin], and constantly humming words such as "bleeding" and "hating people".
This year (1914), in June, my uncle sent me a betrothal gift and wanted [Gan Ma] to be his daughter-in-law and marry your cousin [Falcon]. After [Gui Yin] agreed, the family began to prepare for the wedding.
In August, [Li Gaobai], who had not heard from him for several years, suddenly came to visit the "Wizard's house".
[Li Gaobai] expresses his gratitude to you and [Gui Yin] - you find that after not seeing each other for several years, this young man has become more knowledgeable and well-spoken, so you are happy for his dead brother.
You wanted to stay with [Li Gaobai], but because of his work, he had to live with the "experts" in the "Inn" hotel - [Gan Ma]. During that time, he often went out and returned late, and did not meet [Li Gaobai] that day.
Yesterday (September 15th), a fire broke out in "Xiya", and [Gui Yin] took people to put out the fire. Then [Gan Ma] came to you and wanted to rent the second floor of the east side house where you used to live to a friend to stay overnight (after you got married, you and your husband lived in the "bedroom" on the second floor of the main house) - it's rare for you to hear about [Gan Ma] I had friends, so I agreed.
[Gan Ma] After you go out, you go to clean up the house and see the "wooden box" where the "embroidered wedding dress" and "dagger" are hidden - you can't take it back to the "bedroom" (Gui Yin puts everything neatly - he is very careful , can quickly detect whether there are too many or too few things in their hands), and they dare not keep them, so they throw them into the "Tiger River" outside the window and throw them away.
That night, [Gui Yin] asked his old servant "Yi Bo" to tell him that he went to "Ba's house" to discuss matters, but he didn't return all night.
Today (September 16) is the 27th day of the seventh lunar month, and it is also the death anniversary of [Li Demu]. Every year on this day, you will secretly bring "rice wine" and hand-made "oil daddy" to "Xiya" to offer sacrifices. Kudos to him, this year is no exception.
You get up early and prepare things in the "kitchen", put them in the "back basket", cover them with "flower cloth", carry them on your back and go out, and see your cousins ​​[Falcon] and [Li Gaobai], and a man (Zheng Hanzhen) in the village. Together, when you hear [Gan Ma] calling you from behind, you turn around and see the woman wearing a "mask" (Gan Ma), and next to her is a slightly familiar woman (Chen Sha) - according to you As far as I know, [Gan Ma] has put the "mask" in the "Mountain Spirit Cave" since last fall and doesn't wear it often.


Act 2:
The story after the pleasantries
Everyone accepted the invitation of [Falcon] and came to the "hall" of "Bajia" to dine. There was homemade "rice wine" at the table - [Gan Ma] never took off his "mask" and never ate or drank. -[Ba Mansion Mountain] is not at home. I heard someone said that he and "Wizard" [Gui Yin] went out early in the morning.
After finishing the meal, the servants cleared the table and served refreshments. At this time, you heard [Ba Mansion Mountain] and [Gui Yin] talking while returning to "Ba's House". They continued talking outside the "hall" door - You vaguely heard [Ba Mansion Mountain] ask: "...who is it?" [Gui Yin] said: "I guess...this person was there..." [Ba Mansion Mountain] then said: "If that's the case, I will go to the "old wooden house'..." [Gui Yin] lowered his voice: "...the one closest to the river... ." [Ba Mansion Mountain] said fiercely: "If it is true... I can't forgive you..." [Gui Yin] said: "I will go back and use "Ling Divination" to confirm... ....Bring that incense with you..."
[Falcon] opens the door and goes out at this time, and the conversation outside immediately stops - because when you open the door, you see [Ba Mansion Mountain] and [Gui Yin] outside the door, both of them are very dirty... [Gui Yin] Say goodbye to [Ba Mansion Mountain]. If you want to know what happened to your husband, you take [Gan Ma] and [Gui Yin] home, and [Gan Ma] pulls [Chen Sha] and leaves together.
At about 13:00, you returned to the "Wizard's House". You put down the "basket" covered with "flower cloth" at the door, and walked up to the second floor of the main house with your husband. [Gan Ma] took [Chen Sha] to the east side room.
[Gui Yin] Go upstairs and walk into the "quiet room" (the quiet room contains "Wizard" medicine and a shrine, which can lead to the "terrace"), and asks you to go back to the "bedroom" to get him a piece of clean clothes. You Go to the "bedroom" to find a neat "old black robe", take it back to the "quiet room" and give it to your husband, and then ask him what happened and what are he and [Ba Mansion Mountain] going to do?
[Gui Yin] gave you the dirty clothes he had changed out of, but did not answer. Instead, he said that he wanted to perform "spiritual divination" and that he had to quietly enter trance (the length of trance varies, sometimes lasting several hours). During this period, he could not be disturbed by anything. No one disturbs you - After saying this, he will let you leave the "quiet room", then close the door and bolt it inside.
You feel aggrieved outside the "Quiet Room", but you dare not knock on the door again - you have heard since childhood that the "Wizard"'s "spiritual divination" is different from ordinary divination. You must first enter concentration and then communicate with the "Mountain Spirit", so Never be disturbed - otherwise all your efforts will be wasted, and in severe cases, you may be tempted by inner demons, leading to suicide.
You saw that the "black robe" [Gui Yin] took off was covered in dirt, so you took it downstairs to the main house and prepared to wash clothes by the river outside. Then you saw the "basket" you put down when you returned home and felt You can take the opportunity to worship [Li Demu] first - after you think about it, put the dirty "black robe" on the "barrel" with a lid next to the door on the first floor (plan to wash it when you come back), and cover it on your back again "Flower Cloth" goes out with a "basket" on his back.
You left the "Wizard's House" and walked not far towards the west gate of the village when you were stopped by [Zheng Hanzhen] who came out of the "Ba's House". After greeting you for a few words, he asked you "Chen Sha" Whether she was at the "Wizard's house" or not, he had something important to talk to her about. You said she was here, and then took [Zheng Hanzhen], who had never been to the "Wizard's house", back to the east room. When you went upstairs, you vaguely heard the sound of falling water.
You told [Zheng Hanzhen] that [Chen Sha] should be inside with [Gan Ma] now, and then turned around and left - you were worried that your murder would be exposed, so you didn't dare to talk to [Zheng Hanzhen] and [Chen Sha] more.
The weather was very hot, and you were not walking very fast with your things on your back. Someone called you in the distance behind you. Because you were in a hurry to worship, you pretended not to hear it and walked out of the west gate of the village, bypassing the "cemetery" as usual. Coming to "Xiya" - the familiar sea of ​​​​flaming flowers has now disappeared, and in front of us is only the scorched earth after the fire...
You can't help but recall that when you were a child, your father took you here, and the mountains were full of "Mountain Spirit flowers" in full bloom... Then you met your aunt [Miao Shi], who was teaching [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] to sing A "Song of Mountain Spirit": "Mountain Spirit is not afraid of being pricked by needles (eh), Mountain Spirit loves to be rubbed with bamboo knives (eh), Mountain Spirit sheds tears and sheds white flowers (eh), Mountain Spirit leaves the water and loves to praise (eh)... ....”
While thinking about the past, you walked to the "Tiger River" - you had only heard that [Li Demu] was hanged in the woods near the "Wooden Bridge" in "Xiya", and you didn't know the specific location.
You took out the prepared "oil cake" and put it on the ground on the shore. You took out the wine bottle and poured a bowl of "rice wine". Then you raised your head. Just as you were about to say something, you saw the water a little further away. Next to it, there is a "wooden box" that floated to the shore. It is exactly what you threw into the "Tiger River" yesterday!
You want to go over and pick it up, but suddenly someone emerges from the water of the "Tiger River"!
You were startled, fearing that someone would see you worshiping, so you grabbed the "back basket", hid behind a tree, and then ran to the west opposite to the "Tiger River".
You ran for a while and came to the "Eagle River" in "Xiya" - this is the place where you stabbed [Middle-Aged Man] to death - your head was covered with sweat, and your back felt chilly. You thought of it again. What happened that day...you accidentally let go of your hand, the "back basket" fell to the ground, and the "flower cloth" inside fell into the "Eagle River" and drifted away with the waves.
You want to go home quickly, so you pick up the "back basket" and walk east. On the way, you accidentally glanced towards the "Mountain Spirit Cave" and saw a woman wearing a "mask" coming out - that should be [Gan Ma]. You were afraid that she would ask you why after seeing you. When I came to "Xiya", I ignored the unlucky custom of passing through the "cemetery" and planned to go home through it.
After you walked into the "cemetery", you didn't expect that there were other people there. If you wanted to avoid them, it was already too late, so you could only walk past them.
You stopped in front of a grave mound and saw [Zheng Hanzhen] and [Falcon] covered in mud and water carrying a "thin board coffin" up from the dug grave. The lid of the coffin was not nailed, but just covered. !
You catch a glimpse of the words "Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)" on the tombstone nearby, and think that this is the grave of [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)] - [Li Gaobai] stands opposite, staring straight at the coffin.
[Zheng Hanzhen] and [Falcon] then worked together to lift the coffin lid. Inside was a partially decomposed male corpse, with a vague face. You didn’t dare to look at it more, but the corpse seemed familiar. You took the courage to look at it. The face of the male corpse turned out to be that of the long-dead [Li Demu]!
You exclaimed and almost knelt on the ground. You didn’t understand why his body returned to "Sister Mausoleum" and appeared here... Only then did you notice the "mask" [Gan Ma] has come behind you quietly (you can see that her clothes are wet).
Immediately afterwards, [Chen Sha], who was soaked all over, ran from behind you. She was panting heavily. She approached the coffin. After seeing the body inside, she shouted in a trembling voice: "The people inside... .It’s Li Demu!”
After you heard the name again, you couldn't help but cover your mouth with your hands, and it took a lot of effort not to cry - you are married and can't let people discover your past feelings... But you And I really want to know why [Li Demu] appeared in the coffin that was supposed to contain [Juan Ge (Cuckoo Song)]!

Act 3:
next story
At about 16:30, everyone returned to "Bakang Village" and saw "Grandma" playing with her grandson on the roadside. She sang a song belonging to "Ghost Moon" (the seventh month of the lunar calendar). : "Don't go into the water before and after the Zhongyuan Dynasty (yo), if you drown, you will find a scapegoat (yo); don't sleep under a tree in July (yo), if you hang yourself, you will find a scapegoat (yo)..."
You saw [Chen Sha] walking to the east gate of the village alone after saying something to [Gan Ma].
You go home with [Gan Ma] and put down the "back basket" after entering the door - you want to go upstairs to check on your husband, but [Gan Ma] suddenly pulls you and asks you to get her some food - she didn't eat at noon , now I am very hungry and want to eat "youbaba" with eggs in the stuffing... When you walked to the "corral", you saw [Gan Ma] going upstairs.
You go to the "corral" and take out fresh eggs, go upstairs from the east staircase to the "kitchen", mix them with the stuffing you made before, and soon fry up a new "oil daddy" and bring it out for delivery Go to the house where [Gan Ma] lives (Gan Ma's house), but you don't see her. You leave "you dada" in the house and notice that there is a bottle you haven't seen before, and two bowls - you don't Knowing what was in the bottle, he left the bottle and bowl untouched and returned to the "bedroom" to rest.
At about 17:00, you heard a noise outside the "bedroom". It seemed that someone was talking to [Gui Yin] and mentioned the "returning incense". You then walked out of the "bedroom" and saw your cousin [Falcon] who had changed into clean clothes outside the "quiet room", holding the door handle with both hands, and the door was still closed. You are afraid that he will affect [Gui Yin] who is in meditation in the "quiet room", so go over and stop him, saying that your husband cannot be disturbed in there and ask him to come back later.
[Falcon] listened to your words and followed you away. When he went downstairs, he suddenly asked you [Chen Sha] are you back? You said that [Chen Sha] did not return to the "Wizard's house" and did not know where he went.
[Falcon] After walking out of the "Wizard's house", you still didn't see [Gan Ma], so you were a little worried - when you saw [Li Demu]'s body just now, you were flustered, always feeling that something was going to happen.
You went to the second floor of the east side house where you used to live to see if [Chen Sha] or [Gan Ma] were there. You saw the window in the house open, and there was a "bell" and a carry-on bag (bag) on ​​the ground. Style is not something from the village. After you walked downstairs and looked outside the door of "Wizard's House", [Li Gaobai] suddenly walked out of the main room behind you (you didn't know when he went in) - [Li Gaobai] After coming out Just ask you in a low voice [Gui Yin] how long have you been in the "Quiet Room"? You said that after your husband came back at noon, he locked himself in and asked others not to disturb him... (As far as you know, if Gui Yin sees an outsider entering the "quiet room", he will definitely call the old servant " Yibo" drives the other party away)
Then you saw [Falcon] coming again, and with him was [Zheng Hanzhen] who had changed into the clothes in the village, followed by several servants of the "Ba Family".
They came to the door of "Wizard's House", and [Falcon] just asked: "Is Gui Yin out?" You saw [Gan Ma] wearing a "mask" panting and running away from the east gate of the village. come over.
[Gan Ma] ran to the door and shouted: "My brother is in trouble!" Then he ran into the main house of the "Wizard's House" - you followed her into the house and climbed up the stairs on the west side to the second floor together.
[Gan Ma] tried hard to hit the door of the "quiet room", but couldn't open it because of the latch inside.
[Falcon] grabbed [Gan Ma] and asked several servants to bump into it, and finally broke the door open - there was no one in the "quiet room", and there were some things scattered on the ground - [Gan Ma] ran to the "terrace" first, You follow her and see a "rope" tied to the east railing of the "terrace", as if something is hanging outside...
You felt scared and saw [Falcon] hugging [Gan Ma], both of them shaking - at this time [Chen Sha] who had changed into clean clothes also appeared on the "terrace". [Li Gaobai] ran to the "railing", looked down, and shouted: "It's Gui Yin!"
You were shocked, wondering if your husband was still alive, so you immediately shouted: "Pull him up quickly!"
[Zheng Hanzhen] immediately went over and worked with [Li Gaobai] to pull up the "rope" and pulled the body with the "rope" tightly around the neck out of the "terrace" and placed it flat on the "terrace" - the deceased It’s your husband [Gui Yin]!
The sun has not set yet, but you suddenly feel a chill... Maybe [Gui Yin] is not the only one who died today...
