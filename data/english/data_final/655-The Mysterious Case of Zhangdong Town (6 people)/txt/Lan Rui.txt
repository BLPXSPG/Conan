September 25, 1914 (the third year of the Republic of China)
After the outbreak of World War I, the imperial powers were busy on the European battlefield, but they still did not forget to split China and absorb China! As the ancient capital of six dynasties, Nanjing has experienced the baptism of the war against Yuan Dynasty, and the "Ten Miles of Qinhuai" is still singing and dancing. In Anhui, across the river from Nanjing, there is a "Hao River" originating from the northern foot of Fengyang Mountain. "(not the river of the same name in Jiangsu), from south to north, to Linhuaiguan and into the Huaihe River. It was completed in the third year of Qianlong's reign in the Qing Dynasty (1738). It can pass ships of 3 to 5 tons in summer and autumn, but not in winter and spring. Navigable. After the Qing government stopped water transportation in the 27th year of Guangxu (1901), grain merchants still transported grain here by water.
Not long ago, in a "Lijia Village" along the river, a strange incident of "a water ghost getting married" spread
your story
Your name is [Lan Rui], born in the 24th year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty (1898). You are the daughter of [Zhang Fanghao] who was raised since childhood, but you have vowed to kill him!
You were born in "Zhangzhuang" in the west of "Zhangdong Town" along the "Hao River". Your father [Zhang Fanghao] is a local grain merchant and runs the "Zhangji Trading Company". He goes out by boat for several months every year. Trafficking in rice, you left your mother [Ms. Yao] (Huan Ling), housekeeper [Uncle Yu] and some servants at home. You have not been close to your father since you were a child, and you were even a little afraid of him. When you grew up, you knew that your father wanted to have a baby. The son inherited the incense, but the mother never became pregnant again.
When you were 12 years old (1909), your father wanted to take you to Nanjing - this was your first time away from home. You were inevitably scared, so your mother took off a "jade fan pendant" from her folding fan and asked you to take it with you.
Your father took you on a boat ride on the waterway. You were bumpy with the waves along the way. You were very uncomfortable in the cabin and had nightmares every night. Your father was used to riding on boats and didn't notice your condition. You see, your father was very fond of the people on the boat. Even though I was strict, I didn’t dare to tell him.
After your father brought you to Nanjing, he first visited his adopted brother [Yang Shuixun]. ​​While giving away money, he asked [Yang Shuixun] to help send you to school and take care of you on his behalf. His attitude was very respectful - [Yang Shuixun] accepted Yinzi, he said that we are sworn brothers. This is a trivial matter. He is worried that his daughter will be bullied when she goes to school alone. Everyone is happy to have you study together...
This is how your father left you in the unfamiliar Nanjing - when he left, he repeatedly told you that it is better to be at home when you are away, especially when you are around [Yang Shuixun], you must pay attention to everything, and don't offend him even if you suffer any grievances... ···You have since become the companion of [Yang Shuixun]’s daughter [Minxi], living in the “Yang family”.
[Yang Shuixun] arranged for a young man to pick you and [Minxi] up every day to study at "Huiwen Girls' Middle School" - sometimes [Minxi] didn't want to go home immediately after school, saying she was going to "Yang's" in the city In another garden, the young man who picked you up will accompany her, and you will walk back to the "Yang Family" by yourself... That young man says sorry to you every time - he always makes you feel friendly when he speaks, but Don't know his name.
The next year (1910), on a warm spring day, you were home from school alone, and couldn't help but walk to the bank of the "Ten Miles of Qinhuai River" - you were enjoying the scenery, and suddenly a drunk man stared at you, and you hurriedly Walking back, the drunk man follows you, muttering words like "...little beauty...".
A drunk man ran up to you and tried to grab your wrist. You shouted for help, and a man heard it and stood between you and the drunk man. You turned around and ran away, but the drunk man was stopped by the man and did not catch up. ·····After you returned to the "Yang Family", you were in shock, but because you were living abroad, you didn't mention it to anyone.
Although you live with [Minxi], you have a better female classmate in school - her surname is "Mu" and her name is [Xiting]. She is 1 year older than you and comes to "Huiwen Girls' Middle School" from Yangzhou. Studying, living in the school dormitory, and having a good relationship with a weird "Teacher Bai" (female)... You and [Xiting] often have meals together, and [Xiting] invites you to her dormitory Reading a book, I saw some bottles and jars containing things you didn’t understand - [Minxi] later joined you, and the three of you were always together.
Father comes to see you every year, but he doesn’t spend much time with you, so he invites [Yang Shuixun] to drink on the Qinhuai River...
A year later (1911), the young man who took [Minxi] and you to school was promoted by [Yang Shuixun] to be an "inspector" and was no longer responsible for taking you to school.
In October, after the Wuchang Uprising broke out, schools in Nanjing were closed. You were very panicked, hoping that your father would come to pick you up, but you still couldn't wait for him to show up. - The young man came to pick up [Minxi] from school - You heard [Yang Shuixun] wanted to take [Minxi] back to her hometown to hide, but she didn’t mention you.
Fortunately, you still have this friend [Xiting] - she wants to take you back to your home in Yangzhou to avoid the chaos. [Yang Shuixun] After hearing about it, the young man escorted you - you only then found out that his name was [Shen Wusheng].
[Shen Wusheng] sent you and [Xiting] to the "Mu Family" in Yangzhou. He kept comforting you on the way and made you feel happy... Later, because the rebel army attacked Nanjing, he also stayed at the "Mu Family" "Temporary stay... [Xiting] has a little maid [Xinger] at home. I was very happy to see her come back.
When you lived in the "Mu family", [Xiting] treated you like a family member and let you live with her. At night, when you were lying on the bed and talking about many topics that you had never discussed in school, you learned that [Xiting] You have already arranged a "baby marriage" but you don't know the person yet... You accompany [Xiting] to imagine what her future husband will look like, but you see [Xiting] look worried, and you hear her say that she is afraid of the other person. Like her big brother... you hugged [Xiting], tickled her and "forced" her, and then you found out why she was so scared - it turns out that [Xiting]'s eldest brother had a crush on her when she was very young in Nanjing A woman had a big quarrel with her father, who had betrothed him, and then ran away from home. She has not been heard from again... [Xiting]'s father didn't want to mention it again, but [Xiting] wanted to Only after I find my eldest brother can I go to Nanjing to study. You ask [Xiting], has he found his big brother? [Xiting] smiled bitterly and shook his head. You asked her again what her eldest brother's name was, and said that when she returned to Nanjing, she would help her find it - [Xiting] happily took your hand and told you that her eldest brother's name was [Mu Boxuan]...
You started looking for opportunities to chat with [Shen Wusheng] at that time, and you always felt that he was worried when you spoke.
In 1912, when the world became the Republic of China, Man's braids were cut off. After you lived in the "Mu family" for a while, your father came to pick you up. Your father gave 100 taels of silver to the people in the "Mu family" to thank you, but【 Xiting] asked you to return the money to your father, and said that she and you are good friends, and it is reasonable to help each other, and cannot accept money from your father. Later, [Xiting] and you exchanged mailing addresses and said Keep in touch. You took the money and returned it to your father, feeling that his behavior made you very embarrassed in front of your good friends.
You found [Shen Wusheng] before going home and asked him to go to "Zhangdong Town" with you, but until your father took you to leave Yangzhou, [Shen Wusheng] did not come... You hoped that your father would let you You waited a little longer, but he didn't notice your thoughts at all - so you didn't talk to your father much on the way.
After you returned home, you put the "Jade Fan Pendant" in your room, and then went to see your mother. Your mother was so excited that she cried when she saw you returned safely. In your impression, your mother usually smiles. This is the first time you see her. When she cried so bitterly - you then talked about your experiences outside, and mentioned [Shen Wusheng] more than once.
At this time, my father was still running the ancestral salt and rice shop in "Zhangdong Town". The salt in the shop was cheaper and finer than elsewhere. The rice sold was never adulterated and the price was reasonable - the people in the town Everyone praised him for his conscience in doing business... Mother told you that your father had always hoped that this "conscience" would lead to asking God to give him a son.
Because the goods in the "Zhangji Trading Company" shop are cheap, people from the "Lijia Village" in the north of the town will even go over the mountains to buy here. In order to seek a son, my father also treats outsiders equally. Not only that, his father also gives money to the town every year. Donate money, help those in need and orphans, and earn the reputation of "Zhang Shanren".
In July, you received a letter from [Xiting] and learned that after she and her husband [Gu Chumeng] got married, they rented a courtyard in Nanjing and lived there with their little maid [Xinger]. You also wrote to [Xiting] about your situation, hoping to meet her again.
Last year (1913), the correspondence between you and [Xiting] was temporarily interrupted due to the outbreak of the "War against Yuan". My father did not dare to go out to sell food and concentrated on running a shop in the town. In autumn, you finally received another letter from [Xiting]. You learned that she and her husband had returned to Nanjing, but regretted that they could not come to visit you... When you wrote back, you said that you missed [Xiting] very much and hoped to meet her again. Have a chance to meet again.
This year (1914), in early September, my father went out to visit his teachers and friends.
On September 16th, [Xiting], who looks like a young woman, suddenly came to your home with [Xinger] as a guest. Along with her was [Minxi], whom you haven't seen for a long time. You were very surprised when you saw them and asked them to stay with you. We lived on the second floor of the "South Building" in the backyard (my father and mother lived on the second floor of the "North Building").
You and [Minxi], who are not yet married, are both interested in [Xiting]’s married life. You heard that [Xiting] and [Xinger] could go out to work with [Gu Chumeng], and you envied them.
On September 17, when you went to the river dock for your mother to see if your father was back, you heard a strange thing in the town: when the fishermen from "Lijia Village" went fishing in the river east of "Yangtou Mountain" in the south of the village, He saw a drowned female body suddenly floated up from the water. She was dressed in red. The fisherman swore that he was not dazzled. The female body suddenly floated up from the water at that time! What's even more terrifying is that the female corpse turned out to be a woman who had been taken away by the "Water Ghost Marriage" - someone saw her wearing red clothes on the "Hungry Ghost Festival" and walking into the river by herself, but the body looked like she had just drowned. ! Because the woman had no family in "Lijiacun", no one took the body after it was recovered.
You go home and tell your mother about this. After hearing this, your mother seems to have remembered something and looks sad. She takes out the money from a "mahogany box" and asks someone to send it to the coffin shop to buy a coffin to bury the female body... ·Only tell the outside world that it was your father's idea - you feel that your mother is trying to accumulate some evil deeds for your father.
On September 23rd, in the afternoon, you saw your mother wearing a veil (mother would only wear a veil when going out), wearing colorful clothes, holding a "mahogany box" in her hand, leaving the backyard... In the evening, you saw your mother coming back After taking off the veil, there were tears on her face, and you quickly followed her into the "North Tower".
After your mother saw you, she asked you to close the door, held your hand, and said that there was something she had been hiding from you, and now it was time to tell you. You saw your mother being so solemn, and you couldn't help but get scared.
Then your mother told you a past incident that sent chills down your spine - it turns out that your biological father was not [Zhang Fanghao] - not only that, your biological father was killed by [Zhang Fanghao] himself!
At that time, my mother had just become pregnant with you. In order to save her life, she pretended to be ingratiating and married [Zhang Fanghao]... My mother said that she had been forcing herself to smile during the day and sleeping with her enemies at night, just to keep her away. You raised me... When you heard this and thought of your mother's grievances, you cried and asked your mother who your biological father was?
My mother didn't speak, as if she had an experience she didn't want to remember - you knelt down and begged your mother to tell you, and your mother asked you if you wanted to continue living the way you are now, or would you like to redress your biological father's injustice?
You think of [Zhang Fanghao]'s kindness in raising you, and you can't answer it for a moment... Mother said with a wry smile, if you were a boy, she would have told you everything long ago... In your heart Feeling sour, he grabbed his mother's hand and vowed to avenge his biological father! Your mother then broke out of her tears and smiled, caressing your head, and said that she would tell you everything exactly after redressing your grievance... You looked at your mother's extremely sad smile, and your heart ached. I think [Zhang Fanghao] deserves to die!
You returned to the "South Building", pretended to be inconvenient, and lay down on the bed. [Xiting] and they didn't think much about it - you tried to pretend as usual and waited for the return of your enemy [Zhang Fanghao].
Yesterday (September 24), in the afternoon, you and [Xiting], [Minxi] and the others were eating fried melon seeds and chatting in the "front hall" of the front yard. You heard [Xiting] talk about a major event that happened in Europe not long ago: The Crown Prince of the "Austro-Hungarian Empire", Archduke Ferdinand, was assassinated while he was out. The assassin was a young man under the age of 20. After the assassination, he planned to commit suicide with "cyanide"... When you hear that you can commit suicide, you quickly ask what "cyanide" is?
[Xiting] Go to the backyard and retrieve a bottle filled with white powder. I tell you that this is "sodium cyanide", which is highly toxic and can kill you in just a small dose... While you were talking, you heard someone speaking. "Zhangzhuang" knocked on the door. When the servant opened the door, you saw that the person outside the door was [Minxi]'s father [Yang Shuixun].
[Yang Shuixun] turned around and left after asking a few words. [Minxi] immediately chased after him. [Xiting] put away the "sodium cyanide" and took [Xinger] back to the room.
After dinner, [Minxi] ran back to "Zhangzhuang" crying and rushed into the backyard. You then hear someone knocking on the door outside - after the servant opens the door, you see that the person knocking on the door is actually [Shen Wusheng] whom you haven't seen for a long time.
When [Shen Wusheng] saw you, he immediately asked you if [Minxi] was there. You saw that [Shen Wusheng] was very anxious and had no time to reminisce about the past. He took him to the inner courtyard first. You ran into the first floor of the "South Building" and saw [Xiting] hugged [Minxi] and put his hand into her mouth. [Xinger] was asking what to do... [Xiting] saw you guys coming in and immediately shouted: "Minxi, her father forced her to marry Man, she didn’t want to, so she snatched the poison and ate it—go to the kitchen and get some salt water, the thicker the better!”
After you listen, you immediately run to the kitchen, find the jar with the word "salt" written on it, pour out all the salt inside, mix it into a bowl of thick salt water, take it back to the "South Building" and give it to [Xiting]-[ Shen Wusheng] is helping [Xiting] support [Minxi] and induce vomiting by patting her.
[Xiting] used salt water to induce vomiting for [Minxi] several times before she woke up. Only then did [Shen Wusheng] have time to say that it was [Minxi]'s father who asked him to find [Minxi] and take her back. Inn······
[Xiting] sternly asked [Shen Wusheng] to go back and tell [Yang Shuixun] that [Minxi] will stay here to rest and observe today - she will take good care of [Minxi]!
[Shen Wusheng] walked out of the "South Building" after listening to [Xiting]'s words. You first help [Xiting] and [Xinger] carry [Minxi] to the bed on the second floor, and then go downstairs and ask someone to clean the filth on the first floor.
After you go downstairs, you see the bottle containing "sodium cyanide" on the ground on the first floor, so you pick it up quietly, pour out some of the powder inside and put it in your pocket, then put the bottle back on the ground as it is - waiting for you to go out and call When I came back to clean up, I saw that the bottle was no longer on the ground, so I thought [Xiting] must have picked it up...
In the evening, you and [Xiting] and [Xinger] stayed with [Minxi], and saw that [Minxi] kept crying, looking in pain, but saying nothing.
Today (September 25th), in the morning, [Minxi] went to the inn to meet her father alone. Shortly after you and [Xiting] sent her out, the housekeeper [Uncle Yu] came in to report that a "Master Yang Shuixun" was looking for him. daughter.
You hurriedly asked [Uncle Yu] to invite [Yang Shuixun] to the front hall and tell him that [Minxi] was looking for him. You were worried that [Yang Shuixun], who was unfamiliar with the place in "Zhangdong Town", would meet with [Minxi] again. If he misses it, ask him to stay in "Zhangzhuang" and wait. You go to the inn to find [Minxi] for him, and [Xiting] goes out with you.
There are very few outside tourists in "Zhangdong Town". There is only one "Fu Lai Inn" in the town - you and [Xiting] walked into the main entrance of the inn and saw a handsome man in the lobby, and then saw [Minxi] and [Shen Wusheng] is also there - in addition to them, your "father" [Zhang Fanghao] is also standing in the lobby of the inn, looking very ugly...

At about 10:00, everyone followed [Zhang Fanghao] to "Zhangzhuang". After entering the door, they saw [Yang Shuixun] in the front hall - [Yang Shuixun] came over to say hello when he saw [Zhang Fanghao], and [Zhang Fanghao] returned the favor. Finally, before saying anything, [Minxi] pulled [Yang Shuixun] away. [Zhang Fanghao] whispered to you that he hasn’t eaten anything since he came back, and asked you to go to the kitchen and tell the cook "Uncle Li" to steam the "steamed duck" he brought back, stir-fry two more vegetables, and then send it to you In the north building, he wanted to eat with his wife.
After that, [Yang Shuixun] and [Zhang Fanghao] walked to the side of the front hall, and you went to the kitchen on the east side of the "South Room" in the front yard - you pushed the door and entered the kitchen, and saw that there was a fire in the stove, but "Uncle Li" was not inside. .
When you were making brine yesterday, you emptied out all the salt in the salt shaker. At this time, while no one was in the "kitchen", you put all the "sodium cyanide" that is similar to salt into the salt shaker - although the amount was not enough. It’s a lot, but you know that the “salted duck” is salty enough, and this little salt is enough for “Uncle Li” to cook for [Zhang Fanghao] when he comes back.
You then left the kitchen and returned to the "North Building" in the backyard. You wanted to tell your mother your plan first, and then go to "Uncle Li", but you didn't see your mother in the room. You suddenly had a bad feeling, so you asked The servant "Sister-in-law Li" who was responsible for taking care of her daily life heard that her mother put on a veil and went out early in the morning.
At about 10:30, you didn't bother to find "Uncle Li", walked out of "Zhangzhuang", and asked around in the town. Soon you heard that someone saw a veiled woman going to "Fu Lai Inn" in the morning... ·You rush to the inn, see the innkeeper, and ask him if he saw a woman wearing a veil coming in. The innkeeper nodded first, then turned to look at the backyard.
You immediately ran into the backyard of the inn and saw "Room B" first. Then you looked inside through the window and saw your mother, dressed in white, lying on the big bed in the room, eyes wide open but her body motionless... ···You screamed, and the shopkeeper heard it and ran into the backyard. After seeing the situation in the house, he called someone to open the door...
The shopkeeper came out quickly after entering the room and said that the woman on the bed was dead... When you heard the bad news, you almost fell down. The shopkeeper asked his wife to help you sit down in the lobby, and then asked someone to report it to the official. .
At about 11:00, you came back to your senses and remembered that when you came to the inn in the morning, [Zhang Fanghao] was also here, with a very abnormal look on his face... You immediately ran back to "Zhangzhuang" and rushed Entering the front yard, I saw [Zhang Fanghao] walking into the "North Room" and followed him, filled with hatred.
You entered the "North Room", grabbed [Zhang Fanghao] excitedly, and shouted desperately: "My mother is dead, you killed her!" But [Zhang Fanghao] asked: "What, Huan Ling is still dead? "Then he grabs your hands and tells you not to talk nonsense in front of outsiders!
Only then did you notice the situation around you - [Yang Shuixun] was lying on the ground, [Xiting] was rescuing him, [Gu Chumeng], [Shen Wusheng] and [Minxi] were also in the room. There was a plate of almonds on the table, sprinkled on it There was something that looked like salt... [Xiting] stood up and told everyone that [Yang Shuixun] was dead, and the cause of death should be "cyanide poisoning"...
You immediately guessed that [Yang Shuixun] died because of your poisoning and became [Zhang Fanghao]'s scapegoat. After you knew that you accidentally killed [Minxi]'s father, you finally calmed down and thought about not only finding the murderer of your mother, but also You must also protect yourself... At this time you noticed that there is a button missing from the left cuff of [Gu Chumeng]'s tunic suit.
