September 25, 1914 (the third year of the Republic of China)
After the outbreak of World War I, the imperial powers were busy on the European battlefield, but they still did not forget to split China and absorb China! As the ancient capital of six dynasties, Nanjing has experienced the baptism of the war against Yuan Dynasty, and the "Ten Miles of Qinhuai" is still singing and dancing. In Anhui, across the river from Nanjing, there is a "Hao River" originating from the northern foot of Fengyang Mountain. "(not the river of the same name in Jiangsu), from south to north, to Linhuaiguan and into the Huaihe River. It was completed in the third year of Qianlong's reign in the Qing Dynasty (1738). It can pass ships of 3 to 5 tons in summer and autumn, but not in winter and spring. Navigable. After the Qing government stopped water transportation in the 27th year of Guangxu (1901), grain merchants still transported grain here by water.
Not long ago, in a "Lijia Village" along the river, a strange incident of "a water ghost getting married" spread
your story
Your full name is [Yang Minxi]. You were born in the 23rd year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty (1897). You are originally from Fengyang, Anhui. Your mother died young and you grew up with your father [Yang Shuixun].
Because your father works in the tax bureau in Nanjing, you have lived with him in Nanjing since you were a child. You are used to seeing the style of Jinling. Your father does not have a high official position, but he has several gardens in the city. He dotes on you very much and makes you read and read like a boy. , housework is left to servants.
When you were 10 years old (1906), a businessman friend of your father sent his son [Gu Chumeng] to Nanjing to study, and rented a garden belonging to your father for him to live alone - it was not far from your home, and you got to know Bi. [Gu Chumeng], who is 5 years older than you, calls him "Brother Gu" and often asks your father to take you there to play with him - "Brother Gu" always coaxes you and makes you very happy.
Three years later (1909), "Brother Gu" finished the preparatory course and entered the undergraduate program. You also wanted to go to school, so you pestered your father and finally begged him to send you to a "Huiwen Girls' Middle School" - your father asked a young People pick you up and drop you off at school every day, but you often go to "Brother Gu" after school on the pretext of "asking for advice," and the young man who picks you up and drops you off has no choice but to accompany you there.
My father has always had a wide circle of friends. Among them was Uncle Zhang (Zhang Fanghao), who was in the grain and rice business. He was your father's adopted brother. He came to the "Yang Family" with money and a beautiful girl, saying that this was Her daughter [Lan Rui], please ask your father to help send her to school and take care of her on your behalf. The father accepted the money and said that we are all brothers. This trivial matter is not a big deal. He is worried that his daughter will be bullied when she goes to school alone. There is [ Everyone is happy to study together with Lan Rui... But you don't want to go to "Brother Gu" with [Lan Rui]. Fortunately, she didn't follow you to the garden where "Brother Gu" lives, but Is leaving school alone.
A year later (1910), you found that "Brother Gu" liked to visit "Shili Qinhuai" and spent less and less time with you, which made you feel very sad. Once you went to the garden and did not see "Brother Gu", you returned After returning home, I couldn't help but feel sad, and when I saw the spring flowers blooming outside, I boldly wanted to go to the Qinhuai River to find "Brother Gu".
After you went out, you saw [Lan Rui] on the road. She didn't notice you and ran home with her head lowered. You looked up and saw "Brother Gu" in the distance, so you didn't bother to say hello to [Lan Rui]. Run directly over there - before you get there, you see "Brother Gu" boarding a small boat and leaving the shore.
You don’t know why your heart feels sour and you shed tears. At this time, a drunk man crawls up on the ground next to you. You are startled and you run home quickly... That night, you go and ask your father why so many people like to go there. Tour the Qinhuai River? Father immediately changed his expression and told you not to go to that kind of place, not even to mention it.
You feel aggrieved and ask why "Brother Gu" can go? Father had no choice but to tell you with a smile on his face that bad guys go to those places, and that boy named Gu is not a good guy... You were very reluctant to hear your father say "Brother Gu", so you asked him why. Where does he go to drink with [Uncle Zhang] every time?
Father touched your head and said that you were still young and did not understand adult matters. He and [Uncle Zhang] went there to discuss business... You did not believe that "Brother Gu" was a bad man, and later "Brother Gu" Gu" no longer goes to Qinhuaihe, and focuses on his studies. When you go to see him, you benefit from it and unknowingly improve your grades. In your eyes, the handsome "Brother Gu" is better than anyone else. Not available!
At that time, [Lan Rui] also made friends in school - his surname was "Mu" and his name was [Xiting]. He was the same age as you. He came from Yangzhou to study at "Huiwen Girls' Middle School" and lived in the school dormitory. A weird "Teacher Bai" (female) has a good relationship - [Xiting] and [Lan Rui] often eat together - you later joined them, and the three of them often get together.
Another year passed (1911), and the young man who took you and [Lan Rui] to school was promoted by your father to be an "inspector" and was no longer responsible for taking you to school.
In October, after the Wuchang Uprising broke out, schools in Nanjing were closed. The "inspector" who used to pick you up and drop off Lan Rui was named Shen Wusheng. Your father asked him to come to school to pick you up.
Your father took you back to your hometown in Fengyang to escape the war. [Lan Rui] followed [Xiting] back to the "Mu family" in Yangzhou. [Shen Wusheng] was sent by his father to escort them. Before you could say goodbye to them, you were taken on the train by your father. Take the "Jinpu Railway" to Bengbu first, then take the carriage by land and return to Fengyang... You were very bored during those days in your hometown, thinking about Nanjing and "Brother Gu" every day... ····
In 1912, the world turned into the Republic of China, and Man's braids were cut off. Seeing that the situation had calmed down a bit, your father took you back to Nanjing. You went to find "Brother Gu", but you saw that the garden had long been empty... ··You feel empty in your heart and can’t help but feel sad...
Soon after, [Uncle Zhang] came to pick up his daughter. The father said that [Lan Rui] was not at your home. [Uncle Zhang] hurriedly asked about his daughter's whereabouts. Just tell [Uncle Zhang] that school was closed last year. You and your father went back to your hometown to avoid trouble. [Lan Rui] was taken to her home by a female classmate named [Xiting]... [Uncle Zhang] You also asked where [Xiting]’s home was, and you told him that it was the “Mu family” in Yangzhou, not far from Nanjing.
The next day, [Uncle Zhang] rushed to Yangzhou to pick up [Lan Rui]. Not long after, [Shen Wusheng] also returned to Nanjing - although at that time, due to the change of dynasty, his father lost his backer and lost his previous glory, [Shen Wusheng] still respected him as before.
Last year (1913), the conflict between the North and the South intensified day by day, and the "War against Yuan" finally broke out. Your father once again took you to escape from Nanjing. This time, [Shen Wusheng] also went to your hometown in Fengyang with your father and daughter.
Later, the "campaign against Yuan Jun" completely failed, and your father took you and [Shen Wusheng] back to Nanjing to continue serving in the newly reorganized yamen. One day, you went to the yamen to deliver something to your father, and you met "Brother Gu" in the office building. , you see that he is still handsome, more stable than before, and even more talented, you can't help but your heart beats faster - you told "Brother Gu" that your father was transferred to a new department, and he also talked about some recent developments, you just I found out that "Brother Gu" was actually married!
When you heard this, your mind went blank. You couldn't even remember when you separated from "Brother Gu". You returned home alone and started crying - your father didn't know what happened, and you didn't tell him.
Not only did you not forget "Brother Gu", but you missed him even more, which made you suffer every day - you looked out the window as autumn turned to winter, and your heart seemed to have a layer of ice and snow...
In September of this year (1914), my father received a secret order and was sent to his hometown Fengyang. He specifically named [Shen Wusheng] as his entourage to go with him. After returning home, my father laughed loudly and said to [Shen Wusheng] Things have turned around, and his good days are back!
On September 10, my father left Nanjing with [Shen Wusheng].
On September 14th, you received a letter and an official document from your father. The letter mentioned that he was visiting friends in "Zhangdong Town" and asked you to go to the Yamen to hand over the official document for him. You took the official document to your father's work. , I unexpectedly saw [Xiting] - she was wearing a woman's bun. She was obviously married. She was walking downstairs with a food box and her head lowered, and she didn't notice you. You then saw "Brother Gu" escorting two women out of his office. You followed the two women, listened to their conversation, and guessed that they were members of "Brother Gu's" family, so you mustered up the courage to say hello. We know that they are "Brother Gu"'s mother [Ms. Mei] and sister [Rou'er].
You quickly introduced yourself. [Ms. Mei] had heard "Brother Gu" talk about you and knew that you were the daughter of [Yang Shuixun]. ​​She used to go to his son to study - you then invited them to your home to chat. After a while, they talked about "Brother Gu"...[Ms. Mei] sighed and said that the daughter-in-law her son married was not good. She is still not pregnant and has delayed her son's future - she I regret this marriage very much and want my son to marry another wife... When you hear this sentence, you feel excited in your heart, and then your face turns red.
[Ms. Mei] seems to have read your thoughts and asked you what you think of her son? You were so embarrassed that you could only whisper "Brother Gu" is very good... [Ms. Mei] took your hand and asked you if you have decided on your in-laws? You quickly shook your head, and [Ms. Mei] laughed and said she wanted to talk to your father. You can only tell them that your father is on a business trip - [Ms. Mei] is a little disappointed. You immediately say that your father will be back soon and ask them to come back then.
That night, you left [Ms. Mei] and her daughter at home overnight and gave [Rou'er] some beautiful clothes.
On September 15th, [Ms. Mei] took [Rou'er] to say goodbye and left. You were worried that your father would not come back yet. It happened that [Uncle Zhang] came to visit you. After he heard that your father was not at home, he left a heavy The "blue cloth bag" is given to you to give to your father. You suddenly had a plan and wanted to find an excuse to send something to your father.
After you made up your mind, as soon as [Uncle Zhang] said goodbye, you went back to the house to pack your clothes, took your father's letter and the "blue cloth bag", went to Pukou Station, and took the train to Bengbu - you didn't realize it until you got off the train in Bengbu. I have never gone out alone. Although I know the general location of "Zhangdong Town", I don't know how to get there.
Fortunately, you soon met [Xiting] with a little maid at the station - you were both pleasantly surprised after meeting. You asked [Xiting] where she was going, and she said she was going to "Zhangdong Town" to visit [Lan Rui]... You were overjoyed, but embarrassed to tell her real purpose, so you said you wanted to go there too. 【Lan Rui】． After that, you, [Xiting] and her maid [Xinger] walked together.
[Xiting] Rented a carriage, but it was already late before we arrived at "Zhangdong Town", so we had to stay in the nearby "Lijia Village" - the coachman found an empty house in the village to rent to you, [Xinger] went in first I went to clean it, and when I came out, I said it didn’t look like a house that had not been occupied for a long time. The coachman then told you that this house originally lived in a widow and her daughter-in-law. After the widow died, the daughter-in-law threw herself into the river wearing a red dress...
When you think about staying here tonight, you immediately cover your ears and tell the coachman to stop talking!
On September 16th, you woke up early and didn't see [Xiting] and [Xinger], and saw two memorial tablets covered with cloth in the house, so you ran out to look for them. You walked all the way to the river and looked at the calmness. On the river, I thought of the story I heard yesterday, and couldn't help but feel a chill running down my back... Fortunately, it didn't take long before [Xiting] and the others came to the river to find you. After that, the three of you took a car to "Zhangdong Town" and quickly found the "Zhang Family". After knocking on the door and announcing, you met [Lan Rui].
[Lan Rui] was also very happy after seeing you, and asked the three of you to live with her on the second floor of the "South Building" in the backyard - [Uncle Zhang] The couple lived on the second floor of the "North Building", but at this time he Not at home.
Not yet married, you and [Lan Rui] are both interested in [Xiting]’s married life - but you didn’t expect that [Xiting]’s husband is [Gu Chumeng] - not only that, you also heard [Xiting] say that she and [Xiting] Xinger】You often go out to work with your husband, which makes you unable to help but feel envious and a little jealous...
You still haven't seen your father at this time, but you think that when he comes to "Zhangdong Town" to visit friends, he will definitely visit "Zhangzhuang", so you settle down and wait for him.
On September 23, [Lan Rui] felt inconvenient and lay down on the bed after returning from outside.
Yesterday (September 24th), in the afternoon, you and [Xiting], [Lan Rui] and the others were eating fried melon seeds and chatting in the "front hall" of the front yard, listening to [Xiting] talk about a major event that happened in Europe not long ago : Archduke Ferdinand, the crown prince of the "Austro-Hungarian Empire", was assassinated while he was out. The assassin was a young man under the age of 20. After the assassination, he planned to commit suicide with "cyanide"... ·[Lan Rui] After listening to it, I was very curious about what “cyanide” is?
[Xiting] Go to the backyard and retrieve a bottle filled with white powder. I tell you that this is "sodium cyanide", which is highly toxic and can kill you in just a small dose... While you were talking, you heard someone speaking. "Zhangzhuang" knocked on the door. When the servant opened the door, you saw the [Middle-aged Man] outside the door who was your father. Your father didn't notice you. He turned around and left after asking a few words. You immediately chased him out. - Father Looking back, you were surprised and happy to see you. He took you back to the "Ding Room" in the backyard of "Fu Lai Inn" where he stayed, and you saw [Shen Wusheng] also inside.
[Shen Wusheng] immediately went out to arrange a banquet. You first told your father why you came to see him, and then you told your father that [Ms. Mei] wanted you to marry [Gu Chumeng].
After hearing this, the father became furious, banged the table and cursed: Even if I [Yang Shuixun] are unlucky now, I will not let my daughter become a concubine for others! You were so anxious that you almost cried, and your father comforted you, saying that he had found a good husband for you and would definitely treat you well...
When you heard what your father said, you got angry with your eyes red. After arguing with him for a few words, you didn't listen to your father's explanation. You turned around and rushed out of the door. You ran back to the backyard of the "Zhang Family" from the inn and rushed into the "South Building" , saw [Xinger] holding the bottle of "sodium cyanide" on the first floor, so he grabbed it, opened the lid, poured some into his hand, and was so frightened that [Xinger] ran out to call someone.
You already had a plan in mind. When [Xiting] ran in, you threw down the bottle and said to her: "My father wants to force me to marry. Tell him, I will never marry that person!" After that, you pretended to have swallowed the "sodium cyanide" in your hand, and [Xiting] turned pale with fright. He came over and hugged you, digging his hand into your mouth - you suddenly felt nausea in your throat, hearing [Xinger] asked what to do, and then saw [Shen Wusheng] and [Lan Rui] running in together, so he closed his eyes and pretended to be dead, letting [Xiting] do whatever he wanted - you know your father, as long as he knows that you want to commit suicide , we will definitely agree to your request!
【Xiting】then asked someone to get salt water, saying the thicker the better! You have already vomited once, and you feel someone tapping your back again. Each time it is so hard, it almost shakes your heart out...
You felt extremely uncomfortable, but in order to act realistically, you could only continue to pretend to be poisoned. After that, [Xiting] drank a large bowl of very strong salt water and induced vomiting several times. Your stomach was churning and you had to wake up. You felt as if you were dead. Okay... Then you heard [Shen Wusheng] say that your father asked him to come to you and take you back to the inn... [Xiting] sternly asked [Shen Wusheng] to go back and tell [ Yang Shuixun], you have to stay here to rest and observe today - she will take good care of you!
After [Shen Wusheng] left, [Lan Rui] helped [Xiting] and [Xinger] carry you to the bed on the second floor, and then went downstairs to ask someone to clean the house - you had vomited so much that you had no strength, and you were holding " "Sodium cyanide" has long been spread and mixed with the spit (so no one will find you pretending to take poison)...
In the evening, [Lan Rui] and [Xiting] [Xinger] stayed with you. You almost vomited your intestines before. After lying down, you were still in terrible pain. You kept crying and didn't want to say anything... ·
Today (September 25th), in the morning, you got up with your haggard body and wanted to go to the inn to meet your father alone. After [Lan Rui] and [Xiting] sent you out, you realized that you didn’t know the road in the town - fortunately There is only one "Fu Lai Inn" in "Zhangdong Town", and it didn't take you long to find it.
You walked into the "Ding Room" in the backyard of the inn, saw [Shen Wusheng], and heard him say that your father went to "Zhangzhuang". You want to go back to find your father, [Shen Wusheng] will accompany you out of the backyard - you didn't expect to see [Gu Chumeng] in the lobby of the inn, and couldn't help shouting "Brother Gu", and then you noticed [Uncle Zhang] Also here - then you see [Xiting] and [Lan Rui] walking into the inn from the main entrance...

next story
At about 10:00, everyone followed [Zhang Fanghao] to "Zhangzhuang". On the way, you noticed that the left cuff of the Chinese tunic suit worn by "Brother Gu" was missing a button... See your father who stayed in the front hall. When you arrive at [Zhang Fanghao], come over and say hello. [Zhang Fanghao] returns the greeting, then you take your father away and ask him in a low voice whether he will force you to get married?
Father sighed and said that he didn't dare to force you anymore. Not only that, he also wanted to have a good talk with "Gu" and ask him to divorce his wife, and then it became clear that the matchmaker was marrying you as "Mrs. Gu"... ·You were overjoyed after hearing this, and immediately nodded with a blushing face. Your father could only sigh again, and walked to the side of the front hall with [Zhang Fanghao].
You were very grateful to your father. Thinking that he usually likes to eat fried dried almonds sprinkled with salt to go with wine, you walked up to [Shen Wusheng] and asked him if he could help you go to the town to buy some almonds and bring them back? [Shen Wusheng] nodded in agreement. You wanted to ask [Lan Rui] to help you find some more wine, but you didn’t see her in the front hall - you recalled that you just saw [Zhang Fanghao] and [Lan Rui] saying something, and [Lan Rui] went Inside - you walked into the front yard and entered the "North Room" first, but still didn't see [Lan Rui].
Later, you saw your father walking into the "North Room". When he saw you, he said that he had made an appointment with "Gu". You looked out the door and saw "Brother Gu" and [Xiting] walking into the room on the east side of the "South Room" - you walked over and heard [Xiting] whispering outside the door: "... ...The medicine is on Xinger..." "Brother Gu" asked where [Xinger] is? 【Xiting】says 【Xinger】inner courtyard······
You were anxious for your father to talk to "Brother Gu", so you pushed the door in and saw that it was the kitchen. Only "Brother Gu" and [Xiting] were inside - you told "Brother Gu" that your father was waiting for him in the "North Room", please He hurried over... After "Brother Gu" went out, [Xiting] walked to the stove - you had never cooked before, and you wanted to ask her to help fry the almonds, but you were too embarrassed to ask (after all, you wanted to take them away) Xiting’s husband······
At about 10:30, [Shen Wusheng] walked into the kitchen and handed you a paper bag filled with dried almonds. [Xiting] said he was going to find [Xinger], and when he left the kitchen, you asked [Shen Wusheng] to help you heat and stir-fry the almonds in the iron pot - you went out to find wine yourself.
When you come out, you meet the butler [Uncle Yu] and ask him if there is any good wine in the winery - [Uncle Yu] asks you to wait, and he goes to the North Courtyard to get it for you - After a while, [Uncle Yu] brings it to you. A jug of wine and two glasses.
At about 11:00, you returned to the kitchen with wine and glasses, and saw that [Shen Wusheng] had heated and sautéed the almonds until fragrant, put them on a plate and let them cool. You didn’t stir-fry them, but in order to express your feelings in this dish. To thank your father, you sprinkle salt on the almonds with your own hands (it's like you cooked it) - you find the jar with the word "salt" written on it and see that there is only a little salt left in it, so you sprinkle it on the almonds. Afterwards, you brought the almonds and wine and walked towards the "North Room", followed by [Shen Wusheng].
Before you could reach the door of the "North Room", you heard someone inside banging the table and scolding you for being "ungrateful." You recognized the voice of your father and quickly sent the almonds and wine in. After you entered the room, you saw " "Brother Gu" looked angry and was about to leave, so he put down his things and begged him not to argue with his father. After hearing what you said, "Brother Gu" poured two glasses of wine, drank one of them in one go, and said to your father Apologize.
Father then smiled, took another cup and took a sip, then asked you to go out first, saying that he wanted to chat with [Gu Chumeng] for a while longer. You breathed a sigh of relief and walked out of the "North Room" with your head lowered. 【Shen Wusheng】What happened inside? You said everything was fine inside - then [Zhang Fanghao] and [Xiting] came out of the backyard together. When [Xiting] saw you, he asked if you had seen [Lan Rui]? Before you could answer, you saw "Brother Gu" coming out of the "North Room" to call for someone. [Xiting] ran in after hearing this.
You and [Zhang Fanghao] [Shen Wusheng] also followed into the "North Room" and saw your father lying on the ground, but his body was motionless... [Xiting] was trying to rescue him! You were shocked and saw [Lan Rui] rushing in from outside. She grabbed [Zhang Fanghao] and shouted: "My mother is dead, you killed her!"
[Uncle Zhang] asked back: "What, Huan Ling is dead?" Then he grabbed [Lan Rui]'s hands and told his daughter not to talk nonsense in front of outsiders! [Xiting] stood up and told everyone that [Yang Shuixun] has died. The cause of death should be "cyanide poisoning"...
