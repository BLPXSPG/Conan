story background
September 25, 1914 (the third year of the Republic of China)
After the outbreak of World War I, the imperial powers were busy on the European battlefield, but they still did not forget to split China and absorb China! As the ancient capital of six dynasties, Nanjing has experienced the baptism of the war against Yuan Dynasty, and the "Ten Miles of Qinhuai" is still singing and dancing. In Anhui, across the river from Nanjing, there is a "Hao River" originating from the northern foot of Fengyang Mountain. "(not the river of the same name in Jiangsu), from south to north, to Linhuaiguan and into the Huaihe River. It was completed in the third year of Qianlong's reign in the Qing Dynasty (1738). It can pass ships of 3 to 5 tons in summer and autumn, but not in winter and spring. Navigable. After the Qing government stopped water transportation in the 27th year of Guangxu (1901), grain merchants still transported grain here by water.
Not long ago, in a "Lijia Village" along the river, a strange incident of "a water ghost getting married" spread
your story
Your full name is [Mu Xiting]. You were born in the 23rd year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty (1897). You are from Yangzhou. Your family has been practicing medicine for generations. You have three brothers. As the youngest daughter in the family, one of you is 2 years younger than you. His maid, named [Xinger], is smart and will tell her whatever is on your mind.
When you were 10 years old (1906), you learned that your family had already arranged a "baby match" for you. The bride's name was Gu Chumeng. He was the son of the owner of "Wangmeng Villa" in Taihu Lake. He was currently studying in Nanjing... ···From now on you know that you will marry [Gu Chumeng] when you become an adult······
You have only met your second brother (Mu Zhongding) and third brother (Mu Shuyi) at home. Your father (Mu Cun) never mentioned anything about your eldest brother [Mu Boxuan] - you only heard about it from your mother (Ms. Lin) later. The eldest brother fell in love with a woman in Nanjing, had a big quarrel with his father, who had engaged him, and later ran away from home... Although his father regarded the matter as a family scandal, my mother has always missed her. You also wanted to find your eldest brother, so you asked your father to allow you to go to Nanjing to study. Your father did not agree at first, but your two brothers helped you and you convinced your father.
When you were 13 years old (1909), you were sent to Nanjing by your brothers to study at "Huiwen Girls' Middle School" and lived in the school dormitory. When your brothers left, they gave you many instructions. You held back your tears and reassured them. ······You thought you could find out the whereabouts of your eldest brother when you came to Nanjing, but you didn’t know that searching for a person from more than ten years ago in Jinling City was like looking for a needle in a haystack.
In the second year (1910), you got used to school life, but there was still no news about your eldest brother - you could only ask around the school. A little further to the west was "Ten Miles of Qinhuai", both at school and at home. You are prohibited from going there.
After you were exposed to Western knowledge at school, you became interested in "chemistry". It happened that there was a "Teacher Bai" (female) in the school who had returned from studying abroad. She usually liked to do experiments, so you often went to her to ask questions - "Teacher Bai" "I am very happy when I meet someone asking about chemistry. Every time I will give you some reagents or medicines, you take them back to the dormitory. People in the school often regard "Teacher Bai" as a weirdo, but she tells you that there are also women." A great scientist like Marie Curie, she even won the Nobel Prize.
You also have a friend in school. She is one year younger than you. Her surname is "Zhang" and her name is [Lan Rui]. She was sent to Nanjing to study by her father and lived with a classmate.
You and [Lan Rui] often have meals together, and you also invite [Lan Rui] to read in your dormitory - [Lan Rui]'s boarding house's daughter [Minxi] (Yang Minxi) also goes to "Huiwen Girls' Middle School", she Later I joined you and the three of us were always together.
A year later (1911), the young man who took [Minxi] and [Lan Rui] to school every day was promoted and became an "inspector" and was no longer responsible for taking them to school.
In October, after the Wuchang Uprising broke out, schools in Nanjing were closed. [Lan Rui] was very scared, hoping that her father would come to pick her up, but she could not wait for him - [Minxi]'s father [Yang Shuixun] wanted to take his daughter back to his hometown to escape. , but did not mention [Lan Rui].
Fortunately, [Lan Rui] still has you as a friend - you offered to take her back to her home in Yangzhou to avoid the chaos. After [Yang Shuixun] heard about it, he asked the "inspector" named [Shen Wusheng] to escort you.
[Shen Wusheng] sent you and [Lan Rui] back to the "Mu family" in Yangzhou, constantly comforting you on the way. Later, because the rebel army attacked Nanjing, he also stayed temporarily - [Xinger] was very happy to see you back. ·······You later heard from [Xinger] that her wedding was coming soon, and she would accompany you to get married, so your family would no longer send you to Nanjing to study. You still hadn’t found your eldest brother’s whereabouts. Just one day I went to see [Shen Wusheng] in the evening and said that you had something to ask for, and that your father must not know about it. [Shen Wusheng] nodded and asked what was going on?
You then told [Shen Wusheng] that your eldest brother [Mu Boxuan] ran away from home, and said that although your father did not want to mention it again, as a daughter, you always wanted to help your mother find the whereabouts of his eldest brother. [Shen Wusheng] immediately agreed to this matter, saying that he was favored by the "Mu family" for taking him in, and he should repay it - when he returns to Nanjing, he will find out the whereabouts of your eldest brother, and this matter will be taken care of by him!
[Lan Rui] When you lived in the "Mu family", you treated her like a relative and let her live with you. At night, lying in bed, you talked about many topics that you never talked about in school - you defined yourself as a "doll" Tell [Lan Rui] about the marriage, and she will accompany you to imagine what your future husband will look like. Because you have never met the other person, you can’t help but look worried, saying that you are afraid that the other person will be like your elder brother... ····
[Lan Rui] hugged you and kept tickling you and "forced" you. You couldn't bear it anymore, so you told [Lan Rui] that your eldest brother ran away from home and went to Nanjing to find him. 【Lan Rui】After listening, I asked, have you found your big brother? You smiled bitterly and shook your head. [Lan Rui] asked your eldest brother's name again and said that he would help you find him when he returned to Nanjing - you happily took [Lan Rui]'s hand and told her his eldest brother's name.
In 1912, the world became the Republic of China, and Manchus cut off their braids. [Lan Rui] After living in the "Mu family" for a while, her father [Zhang Fanghao] came to pick her up - [Zhang Fanghao] took out 100 taels of silver and gave it to your family to express his gratitude, and you asked [Lan Rui] to give the money to you Return it to her father, and say that you and she are good friends, and it is only natural to help each other, and you cannot accept money from her father. After that, you and [Lan Rui] left each other's mailing addresses and said that you would keep in touch. In June, [Gu Chumeng] came to Yangzhou to welcome his bride, and you finally met this man - he was 5 years older than you, handsome in appearance, and handsome in manner, which surprised you.
In July, after [Gu Chumeng] got married to you, he rented a courtyard close to his work in Nanjing and let you and [Xinger] live there, and hired two maids to take care of them - it turned out that her husband was in the "Provisional Government" in Nanjing. "I work in public office here. I have to go to the Yamen to work and handle official business every day. I can't get along with you day and night."
You start writing letters to [Lan Rui] and tell her about your situation. I received a reply soon and learned that Lan Rui had returned to his hometown "Zhangdong Town" and looked forward to meeting you again.
In August, Deqing County sent an official document asking for a replacement for the county magistrate, and [Gu Chumeng] was selected by his boss. When your husband came home, he told you the good news. You immediately packed your bags with [Xinger] and prepared to go to the post with him. At that time, the relationship between the South and the interim president (Yuan Shikai) was already tense. Whenever there was a vacancy, both the North and the South sent people, and the person who came to the county first took office. My husband's side was unable to approve the official document because some people were arguing about whether to compete with the North for the position. .
In late September, the husband received the official document. When he and his family came to Deqing County, they met the "Magistrate Mu" who had already arrived. Not only did he get there first, but he also said, "He comes to the government office late, neglects state affairs, and is inconsiderate to the people; late." I scolded your husband with the words "Come to the county, despise the New Deal, and despise the Republic."
Your husband had no choice but to take you back to Nanjing and continue to hold your original position. This setback made [Gu Chumeng] feel deeply that the current situation was changing, and he couldn't help but feel a little depressed... Fortunately, you were gentle and persuasive to him, [Xinger] 】And smart and optimistic, with your company, my husband quickly cheered up.
Last year (1913), the south raised troops to attack Yuan, and your husband sent you and [Xinger] back to "Wangmeng Villa". As a result, the correspondence between you and [Lan Rui] was temporarily interrupted. Later, the "challenge against Yuan Jun" failed, and the husband's department was reorganized. Because his husband was not in Nanjing, he did not participate in the rebellion, and was still recruited by his superiors after the war. Although the current situation was turbulent, [Gu Chumeng] felt that it was more necessary to take on the role now. Public officials contribute to people's livelihood and are determined to serve.
My father-in-law (Gu Lianshan), mother-in-law (Ms. Mei) and my husband's sister (Rou'er) all advised my husband not to go back. Only you supported him, which made my mother-in-law very angry. After that, [Gu Chumeng] took you and [Xinger] back to Nanjing and joined the newly established "Culture and Education Department" as a "special commissioner" to investigate the illegal activities of strange forces and gods in various places.
[Gu Chumeng] often drives a carriage when traveling on business, and takes you and [Xinger] with him - you are proficient in medical skills, [Xinger] is smart, and he can discuss any situation with you - In order to protect your safety, your husband gave him a yamen for self-defense The "Mauser Pistol" was given to you, containing 10 bullets.
In autumn, you finally resumed correspondence with [Lan Rui] and told her about the current situation, but regretted that you could not visit her... [Lan Rui] replied that she missed you very much and hoped to have another chance with you. Reunion.
This year (1914), your husband read about the outbreak of war in Europe from the newspaper, and talked about these things with you when he came home. Because your husband was interested, you read the newspaper carefully and saw that the fuse of the war was "Austro-Hungarian". The Crown Prince of the Empire, Archduke Ferdinand, was assassinated while he was out. The assassin was a young man under the age of 20. After the assassination, he planned to commit suicide with cyanide... What do you think? "Cyanide" was curious, so he went to "Teacher Bai" for advice - "Teacher Bai" told you that "cyanide poisoning" is very rapid and can kill people in a short time. Some plant fruits and roots are poisoned It also contains these substances, among which the content of bitter almonds (not the daily sweet almonds) is the highest. The smell of bitter almonds can be smelled in the poison residue... When you say goodbye, "Teacher Bai" is like before Similarly, I give you a bottle of "sodium cyanide" (NaCN), which is a "cyanide", and remind you that just a trace amount of this stuff can cause death.
On September 14th, you spent half a month learning how to cook "Steamed Salted Duck". [Xinger] encouraged you to take it to your husband's work as a surprise for him. You take the food box, pack the "steamed salted duck" and take it to your husband's office - you go upstairs to the door of your husband's office. Just as you are about to go in, you hear a woman's voice inside and you can't help but stop. When I listened carefully, I actually heard that it was my mother-in-law who was criticizing you for her husband, and even blaming you for her husband's failure to become the county magistrate... The husband even agreed with his mother's statement!
You felt sour in your heart, so you didn't go in. You took the food box and lowered your head and went downstairs. You ran back home and were still very sad.
【Xinger】I advise you not to think too much. Although you didn't cry, you still felt bad... After your husband came home, he still chatted with you about the European War that was published in the newspaper. He didn't mention that his mother went to find him. When he found that you were absent-minded, he asked What's on your mind? You just say that you have received an invitation from a female classmate with whom you have a good relationship, and you want to take [Xinger] to her house, and you may have to stay for a while. You hope that your husband will keep you, but you didn’t expect that he would immediately agree to your going. , and also asked [Xinger] to take good care of his wife.
On September 15th, your husband really sent you and [Xinger] to Pukou, Nanjing. Watching you get on the "Jinpu Railway" train, you could only take [Xinger] to "Zhangdong Town" to find "Lan Rui" to relax - "Zhangdong Town" is located in a remote area, so you have to take a train to Bengbu first. After you and [Xinger] got off the bus at Bengbu Station, you met [Minxi] - you and she hadn't seen each other for a long time, so it was a surprise to meet her by chance. [Minxi] After hearing that you were going to "Zhangdong Town" to visit [Lan Rui], she said that she was also going there to visit [Lan Rui], and they happened to be traveling together.
You rented a carriage, but it was already late before you arrived at "Zhangdong Town", so you could only stay in the nearby "Lijia Village" - the coachman found an empty house in the village to rent to you, [Xinger] went inside first to clean it. , after coming out, they said it didn’t look like a house that had not been occupied for a long time. The coachman then told you that this house was originally occupied by a widow and her daughter-in-law. After the widow died, the daughter-in-law threw herself into the river in red clothes... [Minxi] Cover it immediately Shut your ears and tell him to stop talking!
On September 16th, you and [Xinger] got up early to look for the coachman. You didn't see [Minxi] when you returned to your residence, so you looked for her in the village, and then saw [Minxi] by the river to the east of the village. After that, the three of you took a car to "Zhangdong Town" and quickly found the "Zhang Family". After knocking on the door and announcing, you met [Lan Rui].
[Lan Rui] was very happy after seeing you, and asked the three of you to live with her on the second floor of the "South Building" in the backyard - [Lan Rui]'s parents live on the second floor of the "North Building", and her father is not here at this time. not at home.
[Minxi] and [Lan Rui], who are not yet married, are both interested in your married life - when they heard that you and [Xinger] often went out to work with [Gu Chumeng], they both looked envious... ···You are still a little angry with your husband at this time, but you have not told anyone about the bad things he and your mother-in-law said about you behind your back.
On September 23, [Lan Rui] felt inconvenient and lay down on the bed after returning from outside.
Yesterday (September 24th), in the afternoon, you and [Lan Rui] [Minxi] and the others were eating fried melon seeds and chatting in the "front hall" of the front yard, and you talked about "Ferdinand", the crown prince of the "Austro-Hungarian Empire" "The Grand Duke" was assassinated by a boy... [Lan Rui] Like you, when I heard about it, I was curious about what "cyanide" was?
You go back to the backyard, take out the bottle (filled with white powder) from your luggage, take it back and tell them that it is "sodium cyanide", which is highly toxic and can cause death in just a small amount... You are talking. At that time, you heard someone knocking on the door outside "Zhangzhuang". After the servant opened the door, you saw [Middle-aged Man] outside the door and asked a few words before turning around and leaving. [Minxi] seemed to know [Middle-aged Man]. He got up and ran after him. You take [Xinger] back to your room and prepare to put away the "sodium cyanide".
You and [Xinger] just walked back to the backyard when you met [Lan Rui's mother]. She asked you to follow her to the "North Building". You handed the bottle to [Xinger] and followed [Lan Rui's mother] into the house. , when she asked you about [Lan Rui]’s school days, you told her one by one - [Lan Rui’s mother] kept smiling when she listened to you talking, but you felt that there was something hidden behind this smile... ···
After dinner, you saw [Minxi] rushing into the "South Building" and quickly followed her. When you met [Xinger], she ran out to find you and said that [Minxi] had snatched the bottle of "sodium cyanide" from her hand. bottle! You hurriedly ran into the first floor of the "South Building" and saw [Minxi] pouring some "sodium cyanide" into her hands. Then she threw down the bottle and said to you: "My father wants to force me to get married, you tell him , I will never marry that person!"
[Minxi] After saying that, he swallowed what he was holding in front of his face. You were so frightened that you turned pale. You hurriedly ran over to hug [Minxi] and put your hands into her mouth. [Xinger] asked you what to do... At this time, [Shen Wusheng] and [Lan Rui] ] ran in together, [Minxi] had closed her eyes, and you immediately shouted: "Minxi, her father forced her to get married, but she didn't want to, so she took the poison and took it - you guys go to the kitchen and get some salt water, the stronger the better. !”
[Shen Wusheng] came over to help you pat [Minxi] on the back to induce vomiting. [Xinger] and [Lan Rui] quickly brought back a bowl of salt water - [Minxi] had already vomited once, so you gave her another bottle of salt water. After inducing vomiting several times, she woke up - [Shen Wusheng] then had time to say that it was [Minxi]'s father [Yang Shuixun] who asked him to find [Minxi] and take her back to the inn... You are worried that [Minxi] will seek death again, so you sternly ask [Shen Wusheng] to go back and tell [Yang Shuixun] that [Minxi] will stay here to rest and observe today - you will take good care of her.
After [Shen Wusheng] left the "South Building", [Lan Rui] helped you and [Xinger] carry [Minxi] to the bed on the second floor, and then went downstairs to ask someone to clean up the mess. You see that [Minxi] is no longer in danger, so you go downstairs to pick up the "cyanide" and ask [Xinger] to hide it quickly... At night, you and [Lan Rui] and [Xinger] accompany [Minxi], seeing [Minxi] crying all the time, looking painful, but saying nothing.
Today (September 25th), in the morning, [Minxi] was going to the inn alone to meet her father. Shortly after you and [Lan Rui] sent her out, you heard that a "Master Yang Shuixun" was looking for his daughter.
[Lan Rui] hurriedly asked the housekeeper to invite the man to stay in "Zhangzhuang" - you see he is the [Middle-aged Man] (Yang Shuixun) whom he met yesterday, and then [Lan Rui] was going to the inn to pick up [Minxi] Get it back - You are also worried about [Minxi]'s situation, so go out with [Lan Rui].
You followed [Lan Rui] into a "Fu Lai Inn" and unexpectedly saw your husband standing in the lobby of the inn, and then saw [Minxi] and [Shen Wusheng] here - besides them, you also saw [Lan Rui ]'s father [Zhang Fanghao], his face is very ugly...

At about 10:00, everyone followed [Zhang Fanghao] to "Zhangzhuang". After entering the door, they saw [Yang Shuixun] in the front hall - [Yang Shuixun] came over to say hello when he saw [Zhang Fanghao], and [Zhang Fanghao] returned the favor. Finally, before saying anything, [Minxi] pulled [Yang Shuixun] away. [Zhang Fanghao] and [Lan Rui] whispered something, and then [Yang Shuixun] and [Zhang Fanghao] walked to the side of the front hall. [Lan Rui], [Minxi] and [Shen Wusheng] then left the front hall.
When your husband looks at you, you feel that he must be hiding something from you. Just when you are about to ask him, [Yang Shuixun] invites your husband to the "North Room" in the front yard to talk about something important. You and your husband walked into the front yard together and watched [Yang Shuixun] enter the "North Room", but your husband did not go in. Instead, he said that he had something private to say to you and asked [Yang Shuixun] to wait a moment, and then took you away. When I arrived at the "South Room", I saw the door to the east side of the "South Room" was open, so I pushed the door open and went in - this was the kitchen, and there was no one else inside.
Without waiting for you to speak, your husband asked you directly, what kind of medicine can be put into the diet, which is not easy to detect and does not require a high dosage, so that people can die quickly after taking it? You looked at your husband doubtfully, and seeing the anxiety in his eyes, you whispered that there was such a medicine, and it was on [Xinger]... Before you finished speaking, your husband asked [Xinger] Where? You said [Xinger] In the inner courtyard... Then you noticed that a button was missing from the left cuff of your husband's tunic suit.
[Minxi] suddenly opened the door and came in, saying that her father was waiting for [Gu Chumeng] in the "North Room" and asked him to hurry over - her husband separated from you and walked out of the kitchen. You see a fire burning on the stove, and there are a few "steamed ducks" on the stove, but the cook is not in the kitchen... [Minxi] keeps staring at you, as if he wants to say something to you What, but did not speak.
At about 10:30, [Shen Wusheng] walked into the kitchen and handed a paper bag to [Minxi]. You said you were going to find [Xinger] (you began to worry that your husband would go to Xinger to get "cyanide") and walked out. kitchen.
You find [Xinger] in the backyard. Seeing that her expression is different from usual, you quickly ask her what's wrong? [Xinger] said in your ear: "I found that Miss Lan Rui's mother was very strange today..."
"What happened to her?" You asked [Xinger]. [Xinger] opened his eyes wide and said to you: "I saw her wearing a veil and plain silk when going out early this morning - those unusual mourning clothes - they looked like mourning clothes!" You were stunned when you heard this. , feeling that something was very wrong, and asked [Xinger] where was the “cyanide”? [Xinger] said that she hid it yesterday, and you were afraid that your husband would take it away secretly, so you asked [Xinger] to take a look again.
At about 11:00, [Zhang Fanghao] came out of the "North Building", and [Xinger] had already entered the "South Building" - [Zhang Fanghao] came over and asked if you saw [Lan Rui]? You shook your head no. [Zhang Fanghao] frowned and said he wanted to find his daughter, so you said you would go look for him with him. Then you walked into the "South Building" and did not see [Lan Rui].
[Zhang Fanghao] then walked out of the backyard with you and saw [Minxi] and [Shen Wusheng] in the front yard. You asked [Minxi] if she saw [Lan Rui]? Before [Minxi] answered, you saw your husband coming out of the "North Room" to call for someone - you ran over immediately, and after entering the house, you saw [Yang Shuixun] lying on the ground, staring, but his body was motionless... ····You want to save him, but you find that he has died. Then you smell the smell of almonds in his mouth. If you smell it carefully, it seems to be the smell of bitter almonds! [Zhang Fanghao] [Minxi] [Shen Wusheng] also followed you into the "North Room" at this time, and then [Lan Rui] ran in from outside, grabbed [Zhang Fanghao] and shouted: "Mom is dead, It was you who killed her!"
[Zhang Fanghao] asked back: "What, Huan Ling is dead?" Then he grabbed [Lan Rui]'s hands and told his daughter not to talk nonsense in front of outsiders!
You get up and tell everyone that [Yang Shuixun] has died, and the cause of death should be "cyanide poisoning"...
