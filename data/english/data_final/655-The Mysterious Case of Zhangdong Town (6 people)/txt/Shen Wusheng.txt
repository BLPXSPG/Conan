story background
September 25, 1914 (the third year of the Republic of China)
After the outbreak of World War I, the imperial powers were busy on the European battlefield, but they still did not forget to split China and absorb China! As the ancient capital of six dynasties, Nanjing has experienced the baptism of the war against Yuan Dynasty, and the "Ten Miles of Qinhuai" is still singing and dancing. In Anhui, across the river from Nanjing, there is a "Hao River" originating from the northern foot of Fengyang Mountain. "(not the river of the same name in Jiangsu), from south to north, to Linhuaiguan and into the Huaihe River. It was completed in the third year of Qianlong's reign in the Qing Dynasty (1738). It can pass ships of 3 to 5 tons in summer and autumn, but not in winter and spring. Navigable. After the Qing government stopped water transportation in the 27th year of Guangxu (1901), grain merchants still transported grain here by water.
Not long ago, in a "Lijia Village" along the river, a strange incident of "a water ghost getting married" spread
your story
Your real name is [Li Shijia], born in the 18th year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty (1894). You are originally from Anhui. You are from the "Lijia Village" along the "Hao River". You are married to "Caiya", the daughter of the "Wang Family" in Fengyang. "Baby kiss" - This marriage turned into a tragedy after you changed your name, and [Caiya] was also killed by you!
To the south of "Lijia Village" is "Zhangdong Town". The wealthy businessman [Boss Zhang] in the town will escort the cargo ships carrying rice out for sale every year - you have seen the fleet of "Zhangji Trading Company" fully loaded with sacks of rice since you were a child. Passing by the river east of "Lijiacun", I felt it was very grand.
When you were 16 years old (1909), despite the poor health of your parents, you insisted on going out to make a living. At that time, the "Jinpu Railway" connecting the north and the south had not yet been completed. You went to the "Zhangdong Town" dock and wanted to take the ship of [Boss Zhang]. Nanjing, but was kicked off by the steward. Feeling unsatisfied, he told the people on the boat that when you become successful in the future, these people will definitely regret it! They all took it as a joke.
Then you can only walk to Huai River, then take a boat to Nanjing, find a club of fellow Anhui people, and get a job as an errand boy after being guaranteed by the fellow villagers - your employer is [Master Yang] who works in the tax yamen. Shuixun) is also from Anhui. He has several gardens in the city. His wife died young and he has only one daughter [Minxi]. She is younger than you, has a delicate appearance, and is well-educated.
[Master Yang] asked you to take [Minxi] to school at "Huiwen Girls' Middle School", but sometimes [Minxi] didn't want to go home immediately after school and wanted to go to another garden of the "Yang family" in the city. You have no choice but to accompany her there. At that time, the garden was rented by a young master from a businessman's family - his name was [Gu Chumeng], he was only 2 years older than you, but he was young, rich, and behaved in a romantic manner - you lamented that he had different backgrounds and different circumstances, but he could only work hard and work hard. Strive for the appreciation of noble people. Later [Boss Zhang] also sent his daughter [Lan Rui] to Nanjing to study, and she stayed at [Master Yang]’s house. You sent the two ladies to school every day, and you never made any mistakes.
You watched [Minxi] grow up and become more and more beautiful day by day, and you had the idea of ​​​​marrying her. Therefore, when [Yang Shuixun] asked about your family situation, you hid that you were engaged - every time you sent
When [Minxi] went to find [Gu Chumeng], [Lan Rui] went back alone. You can only say sorry to her.
Because [Yang Shuixun] couldn't live without people around him to run errands, you didn't even come home after the death of your father [Li Houshi] - [Yang Shuixun] therefore valued you, and two years later (1911), he promoted you to work in the yamen "Inspection", you only had time to go home during the holidays, and you were urged by your mother [Ms. Zhang] to marry [Caiya].
Soon after you got married, you left your wife at home to take care of your mother, and returned to Nanjing alone. Because the "inspection" work was risky, you couldn't use your real name. Thinking that you were born in the "Jiawu Year" and looking forward to getting ahead, you changed the name to "A" He came forward and took the pseudonym [Shen Wusheng] from then on.
You have been with [Yang Shuixun] for a long time, and you gradually understand why a low-level official like him is so rich - as the saying goes, "the county official is not as good as the current manager", [Yang Shuixun] is in charge of taxation, and many wealthy businessmen want to Bow your head in front of him. The old man from [Gu Chumeng] also has to come to [Yang Shuixun] on time to "pay tribute" to [Yang Shuixun] so that he can make money safely. If you think you will have such an opportunity in the future, you may not be inferior to those rich young masters in your whole life!
In October, after the Wuchang Uprising broke out, schools in Nanjing were closed. [Yang Shuixun] asked you to go to school to pick up the girl. After you changed to "inspection", you never sent [Minxi] to school again. It is inevitable to see her again at this time. A little excited - until now, [Minxi] didn't know your name was "Shen Wusheng".
As the rebel army approached Nanjing, [Yang Shuixun] wanted to take her daughter back to her hometown to escape. At that time, [Boss Zhang] did not come to pick up [Lan Rui]. There was a female classmate named [Xiting] in the school who was willing to take [Lan Rui] there. Her family - [Yang Shuixun] will let you escort them. You were ordered to send [Xiting] and [Lan Rui] to the "Mu Family" in Yangzhou. Later, because the rebel army attacked Nanjing, you did not dare to go back and asked the "Mu Family" to let you stay temporarily.
The "Mu family" has been practicing medicine for generations and has always been a benevolent doctor. Not only did the "Mu family master" agree to let you stay, he also didn't need your help and lived in the "Mu family" like a guest. You were very grateful to "Master Mu" and asked if there was anything you could do in return - "Master Mu" said it was just a trivial matter and he also wanted to thank you for escorting his daughter back...
【Xiting】Ceng came to you at night and said that she had something to ask for, and that her father must not know about it. You nodded and asked what was going on? [Xiting] said that she has an eldest brother named [Mu Boxuan] who fell in love with a woman in Nanjing more than ten years ago, so he had a big fight with his father who got him engaged, and then ran away from home. He is still here today. No news at all... Her father didn't want to mention the matter anymore, but as a daughter, she always wanted to help her mother find the whereabouts of her eldest brother. You immediately agree to [Xiting], saying that you have received the kindness of being taken in by the "Mu family", and you should repay it - when you return to Nanjing, you will find out the whereabouts of her eldest brother, and this matter will be taken care of by you!
When you lived in the "Mu family", every time [Lan Rui] came to chat with you, you would think of [Minxi] and miss returning to Nanjing.
In 1912, the world became the Republic of China, and the Man cut off his braid. You lived in the "Mu Family" for a while, [Boss Zhang] came to the "Mu Family" to pick up [Lan Rui] - [Lan Rui] before leaving, Asked you to go to "Zhangdong Town" with her, but you still remembered that you were despised by [Boss Zhang]'s cronies, so you didn't go... Later you heard that [Yang Shuixun] returned to Nanjing, so you Say goodbye to the "Mu family" and return to the Yamen.
When you see [Yang Shuixun] again, you will see that he has lost his former glory - it turns out that with the change of dynasties, [Yang Shuixun]'s backers fell one after another. He spent a lot of money to distance himself, and the people who used to flatter him no longer come to visit him. , you are the only one who still respects [Yang Shuixun] as before, which moved him quite a lot. He took you to drink at "Shili Qinhuai" and cursed "the one with the surname Zhang" and "the one with the surname Gu" to make him forget , what kind of sworn friendship is just to use him, and in the end make him suffer!
You keep comforting [Yang Shuixun], but in your heart you feel that it is just human nature - for example, if you are still polite to him now, it is just because you are thinking about his daughter - you have already noticed that [Yang Shuixun] has not given any advice to [Minxi] 】Looking for his husband's family because he wants to recruit a "son-in-law".
Later, you heard a joke in the yamen and felt very happy - it turned out that [Gu Chumeng] also held a public office in Nanjing, and almost became the county magistrate of Deqing County, but he was sent from the north because he arrived late with his family. Everyone got there first and could only come back in despair.
Last year (1913), the conflict between the north and the south became increasingly intensified, and the "War against Yuan" finally broke out. [Yang Shuixun] fled again. This time, he took you and their father and daughter to his home in Fengyang. Hometown - At this time, the "Jinpu Railway" has been completed. You took the train from Nanjing to Bengbu on the same day, and then took the carriage and took the overland road to Fengyang. After the "challenge against Yuan Jun" completely failed, [Yang Shuixun] took you and your daughter back to Nanjing to continue serving in the newly reorganized yamen.
In September of this year (1914), the superior of the yamen gave [Yang Shuixun] a secret order and sent him to Fengyang. [Yang Shuixun] named you to accompany him - you follow [Yang Shuixun] and look at him when he gets home haha He laughed and told you that things have changed and his good days are back!
On September 10th, [Yang Shuixun] first took you to Fengyang for a business trip. I heard that the salt price here was due to the announcement of
"Salt Tax Ordinance" and increased.
On September 11th, [Yang Shuixun] took you to "Zhangdong Town" - you never told [Yang Shuixun] that you had a wife, so when you passed by "Lijia Village", you did not go back.
[Yang Shuixun] quickly found "Zhangzhuang" in "Zhangdong Town" and told the gatekeeper to come and visit [Boss Zhang]. After the gatekeeper went in to report, the man who came out claimed to be [Uncle Yu], the butler of "Zhangzhuang". After some brief greetings, [Uncle Yu] said that the boss was out visiting his mentors and friends and was not at home. Please come back in a few days.
[Yang Shuixun] looked unhappy and took you to stay in the town. You found a "Fu Lai Inn". I heard that it was the only inn in the town. When you checked in, [Yang Shuixun] said that you were "Yang from Nanjing" and "Yang Shuixun" "Nanjing Shen". Later, in order to live comfortably, he asked for a "small room" (a multi-person room) in the backyard. He slept in it and you slept outside near the door.
The next day (September 12th), [Yang Shuixun] went to "Zhangzhuang" again, but still did not meet [Zhang Fanghao]. When he came back, he was a little depressed and asked you to send a letter and official document back to Nanjing. You see the address on the letter is addressed to [Minxi]. After you return from sending the letter, accompany [Yang Shuixun] to drink in the room. After a few glasses of wine, [Yang Shuixun] sighed and praised you for being the best person, but unfortunately you are not his son. Then [Yang Shuixun] said that he wanted to marry his daughter to you, but you have to marry into his family and have children in the future. The child will take his surname Yang... You finally waited for this moment, and you were so excited that you knelt down and kowtowed on the spot - [Yang Shuixun] laughed and said that he had several properties in Nanjing and thousands of taels of gold and silver at home. At that time, it will be left to you and [Minxi]... You were overjoyed after hearing this. You never thought that besides [Minxi], you would also inherit a large amount of property in the future!
On the afternoon of September 16th, [Yang Shuixun] thought that the food and wine at the inn were not good, so he asked you to go to the town and buy him two taels of sweet almonds, fry them dry and drink them with wine. You accepted the order happily and went out to look for a shop selling dry goods.
You are not familiar with "Zhangdong Town". It was getting late when you found a pharmacy selling sweet almonds by the river. When you came back from shopping, you passed by the dock by the river and saw many cargo ships. You thought it might be [Zhang Fanghao] coming back, so you got on the ship. You didn't meet anyone watching the ship, but you saw a woman in red. You focused your eyes. At first glance, the woman in front of me is actually your wife [Caiya]!
You immediately ask your wife why you are here? [Caiya] said that there was no salt at home for a long time. She heard that the salt here is cheap, so she came to buy it...[Caiya] said that she burst into tears and asked where you died and why you haven't been there for so many years. When you go home, she thought you were dead...
You quickly covered your wife's mouth, and no matter how hard [Caiya] struggled, you didn't dare to let go - you finally got [Yang Shuixun] to recognize you as your son-in-law, and you couldn't let him know that you were married! [Caiya] soon stopped moving. You saw that she had fainted, so you became cruel - you found a rope, tied [Caiya] and the sacks of rice on the boat together, pushed her into the river, and watched as she sank to the bottom. -Each bag of rice weighs a hundred kilograms. It can completely hold the body without floating up, so no one will know about it!
After you finished doing this, you immediately escaped from the boat and ran back to the inn. You took out the sweet almonds and asked the waiter to take them to the kitchen to heat them up. You drank a few more sips of wine to calm down your shock. After that, you fried the dried sweet almonds according to [Yang Shuixun]'s taste. Sprinkle salt on it, take it back to the "Ding Fang" with the wine, and explain that it is not convenient for shopping in the town and that you will be late when you come back. [Yang Shuixun] didn't think much about it and started eating and drinking with you.
On September 17th, you went to the dock early in the morning and saw that no one there found the body, so you breathed a sigh of relief... Since [Yang Shuixun] recognized you as his son-in-law, he no longer treats you as an outsider. , and begins to tell you about his previous experiences and various ways to make money.
On September 23, in the afternoon, [Yang Shuixun] went to "Zhangzhuang" again and came back in the evening. After entering the house, he smiled and said that although he did not see [Zhang Fanghao], he got the handle of "Gu" -You asked him which "surname is Gu"?
【Yang Shuixun】Which one else is there? It's [Gu Chumeng] from the "Secretary of Culture and Education" - this guy is currently living in "B Room" in the backyard - when he returns to Nanjing, he will make this ungrateful guy look good! After saying this, [Yang Shuixun] wrote an anonymous "reporting letter" for you to keep. You know that [Yang Shuixun] has been angry with [Gu Chumeng] since he got a new job, and has never visited the "Yang family" again. Now that he heard that he was going to be unlucky, he felt happy.
Yesterday (September 24), in the afternoon, [Yang Shuixun] went to "Zhangzhuang" again, and when he came back, he brought [Minxi] with him. You immediately went to the inn kitchen to prepare dinner. After you told the cook to prepare the wine and food, you returned to "Ding Outside the door of the room, I heard [Minxi] and [Yang Shuixun] arguing, and then [Minxi] rushed out of the door. In the room, [Yang Shuixun] slapped the table and cursed why this girl fell in love with [Gu Chumeng] ! You were shocked. [Yang Shuixun] saw you and asked you to chase [Minxi] back quickly, saying that she might have gone to "Zhangzhuang".
You left the inn and ran to "Zhangzhuang". After knocking on the door, you saw [Lan Rui] and immediately asked her if [Minxi] was there. Seeing that you were so anxious, [Lan Rui] took you to the inner courtyard and ran into " On the first floor of "South Building", I saw [Xiting] dressed as a young woman holding [Minxi] and digging her hand into her mouth. A maid was asking her what to do... [Xiting] saw you guys coming in , immediately shouted: "Minxi's father forced her to get married, but she didn't want to, so she took the poison and drank it - you go to the kitchen and get salt water, the thicker the better!"
You heard that [Minxi] would rather die than marry you, and you couldn't help but feel angry and hate [Gu Chumeng] even more. You thought that as long as this guy lives for a day, you will not be able to marry [Minxi] - Although [Yang Shuixun] values ​​you, But he feels more sorry for his daughter. Maybe it won’t be long before he will follow [Minxi]’s wishes... At this time, you see a bottle on the ground next to [Minxi], which contains white powder. Thinking of just now [Minxi] Xiting] mentioned poison, and he immediately thought of a poison plan.
You wait for [Lan Rui] and the maid to go out, pretend to help, slap [Minxi] on the back hard to induce vomiting, pick up the bottle when [Xiting] is not paying attention, pour some of the powder inside and put it in your pocket, and then put the bottle Place it back on the ground. Not long after, [Lan Rui] and the maid brought back a bowl of water, and [Xiting] used it to induce vomiting several times in [Minxi] before she woke up.
Only then do you have time to explain that [Minxi]’s father [Yang Shuixun] asked you to find [Minxi] and take her back to the inn. After listening, [Xiting] sternly asks you to go back and tell [Yang Shuixun] that [Minxi] will stay here to rest and observe today - she will take good care of [Minxi]!
You listened to what [Xiting] said and told [Yang Shuixun] what happened when you went back. When [Yang Shuixun] heard that his daughter was seeking death, he began to hesitate and said that he had to think about some things carefully and asked you to take away the food and wine. He didn't. Think about eating - you give food and wine to the cook and waiter to eat and drink. Watching them sweat after drinking, you go to the well to get water, take off your clothes and take a shower before going back to the dormitory to sleep.
Today (September 25th), before dawn, you ran into the dormitory in the backyard of the inn. The waiter was still asleep due to a hangover, so you took his clothes and put them on, wrapping a rag on your head as a turban - after you stayed in the hotel , knowing that the tea in each room was brought by the waiter when he got up early, he went to the kitchen, made a pot of tea with hot water, put all the poison he got yesterday into the teapot, and then took it to the backyard "B "Room", seeing that [Gu Chumeng] was still in bed, you listened to his words, put the teapot on the table, and then came out - it was just dawn, you were wearing a "turban" and kept your head down after entering the room. He speaks with the local accent here ("Zhangdong Town" and "Lijiacun" are only separated by a mountain, so there is not much difference in accent), so [Gu Chumeng] has no doubts.
After that, you go to the dormitory to take off the waiter's clothes, take off the rag, and return to the "small room". After [Yang Shuixun] woke up, you pretended to have just gotten up - [Yang Shuixun] was worried and said that he was going to "Zhangzhuang" to see his daughter. You wanted to follow him out, but he asked you to stay at the inn.
Soon, [Minxi] came to "Dingfang" to find her father. You told her that [Yang Shuixun] had gone to "Zhangzhuang" and that [Minxi] was going back to "Zhangzhuang". You saw that her face was haggard, so you accompanied her. Get out of the backyard.
[Minxi] suddenly shouted "Brother Gu", you looked up and saw [Gu Chumeng] standing alive in the lobby of the inn, you were shocked, and then you noticed that [Boss Zhang] was also here - and then you saw [ Xiting] and [Lan Rui] walked into the inn from the main entrance...

At about 10:00, everyone followed [Zhang Fanghao] to "Zhangzhuang". After entering the door, they saw [Yang Shuixun] in the front hall - [Yang Shuixun] came over to say hello when he saw [Zhang Fanghao], and [Zhang Fanghao] returned the favor. , before saying anything, [Minxi] pulled [Yang Shuixun] away. [Zhang Fanghao] and [Lan Rui] whispered something, then [Yang Shuixun] and [Zhang Fanghao] walked to the side of the front hall, and [Lan Rui] walked into the room on the east side of the "South Room" in the front yard. [Minxi] came over and asked if you could help her go to town to buy some almonds and bring her back?
You nodded in agreement, but thinking that you bought it at the riverside drugstore last time, you thought it was too far, so you went to the butler [Uncle Yu] and asked him if there was any other shop in town where you could buy "sweet almonds"?
[Uncle Yu] said that there is no need to go out to buy, there are a lot of dry goods such as melon seeds and almonds in "Zhangzhuang". After he said that, he took you to the warehouse on the west side of the "South Room" in the front yard to find it.
After you followed [Uncle Yu] into the warehouse, you saw [Gu Chumeng] and [Xiting] going to the room on the east side of the "South Room" (next door to you) - you leaned against the wall and vaguely heard [Gu Chumeng] asked [Xiting] what kind of medicine can be put in the diet, which is not easy to detect and does not require a high dosage, so that people can die quickly after taking it? You were shocked, wondering if [Gu Chumeng] had noticed that his tea was poisoned - then [Uncle Yu] found a bag of dried almonds and handed it to you.
You walked out of the warehouse and saw [Minxi] walking into the room on the east side of the "South Room", and then [Gu Chumeng] came out and went to the "North Room".
At about 10:30, when you walked into the east room and handed the paper bag containing almonds to [Minxi], you noticed that this was the kitchen. [Xiting] then said he was going to find [Xinger] and left the kitchen. [Minxi] asked you to help her heat and stir-fry the almonds in the iron pot, so you stayed and did as she was told, and [Minxi] walked out.
At about 11:00, you heat and saute the almonds, put them on a plate and let them cool. [Minxi] comes back with a pot of wine and two cups. Then she finds the salt shaker, sprinkles salt on the almonds, and carries Almond and Wine walked towards the "North Room" and you followed them out.
You followed [Minxi], and before you reached the door of the "North Room", you heard someone inside slamming the table and scolding him for being "ungrateful". You recognized the voice of [Yang Shuixun] - [Minxi] quickly put down the almonds and wine. Sent in.
You waited outside for a while and saw [Minxi] come out with her head lowered, so you asked what happened inside?
[Minxi] said everything was fine inside... At this time, [Zhang Fanghao] and [Xiting] came out from the backyard together. When [Xiting] saw [Minxi], he asked her if she had seen [Lan Rui]?
Before [Minxi] could answer, you saw [Gu Chumeng] coming out of the "North Room" to call someone. After hearing this, [Xiting] ran in, and you and [Zhang Fanghao] and [Minxi] followed behind. Entering the "North Room", I saw [Yang Shuixun] lying on the ground, eyes wide open, but his body was motionless... [Xiting] was trying to rescue him. While you were in shock, [Lan Rui] rushed in from outside. She grabbed [Zhang Fanghao] and shouted: "My mother is dead, you killed her!"
[Zhang Fanghao] asked back: "What, Huan Ling is dead?" Then he grabbed [Lan Rui]'s hands and told his daughter not to talk nonsense in front of outsiders!
[Xiting] stood up and told everyone that [Yang Shuixun] had died, and the cause of death should be "cyanide poisoning"... Then you noticed that there was a button missing from the left cuff of [Gu Chumeng]'s tunic suit.
