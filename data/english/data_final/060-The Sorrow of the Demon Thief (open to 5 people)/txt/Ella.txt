You are the performance assistant of the magician Gust. You have been doing this job for two years. Although the income is not high, it is easier. The only thing that makes you trouble is the entanglement of you. You know, you are a young and beautifulWoman, and Gust is already a middle -aged uncle of 40 or 50, and naturally he will not catch a cold.However, in a very chance, he showed the financial resources that surprised you, and began to buy some very valuable gifts for you, but you know what he wants to do, and you will not be with him.
Before today's performance, Gust changed into a very expensive custom suit. You know, this clothes can only be worn by accepting celebrities or performing in large cities.It's just a desolate border town, and there are no celebrities here. Why did he wear so formal, and also told you not to wear too much, you don’t know what Guster wants to do, until six hours before the performance,When you go through the stage curtain, you hear a conversation between Rowling and Thetrical Work David, which is responsible for promoting.Gust wants to propose to you in today's performance. He knows that you have no way to refuse the image of the entire theater.There is a buzzing in your head, without hearing what Rowling and David said next, just hear a few fragmented words "key, five years, property".
In order to find a way to ask Gust's entanglement, you must destroy the performance. You found the security guard Kevin. Kevin is a young guy, but a little rigidity. He found in a city after a performance. At that time, he was wandering at the time.You explained the situation to the group and accepted him, because he had a stupid energy, so he left him to do security in the group, and gust didn't say much.You and Kevin simply explain the situation. I hope he can help you and you save him, so he obeys you more, and he immediately promised you to destroy the performance and find a way.Three hours before the performance, Kevin returned and told you that there is a poisonous snake in which the bite can temporarily paralyze and put it in the dark road under the stage.Is there any toxicity of a snake?
After you thanked Kevin, you prepared a little, and entered the theater from the entrance of the theater (you did not go behind the stage, because your temporary residence was outside the door, from.On the stage, it seems to be checking something, the dark road door is opened, so that you have no chance to go to the snake.You must know that the entire magic process is like this. The wooden boards that are prepared for Gust can be opened and closer. When the performance starts, when the box is closed, the magician will then open the hidden door of the music, and thenHidden under the stage, this secret space is also connected to the scene, which is convenient for other performances.So you have no way to arrange it now. You want to turn around and leave, but you can see that Gust is coming to the theater. As a last resort, you can only hide under the seat of the auditorium. After seeing Guster enter the theater, you can go directly to the stage., But I did n’t hear the voice of a conversation, did n’t I talk here intentionally?Or is Griff left?What do Gust come here now?With a lot of questions, about five minutes later, you leaned your head out. You didn't see others. You hurried to the stage with the box, and the secret door was still opened.The box of the performance item is replaced by the box with a poisonous snake in your hand, and then climbed to the stage and left from the main entrance.
In the next period of time, you have been staying in your temporary room and start planning how to leave the troupe.Until an hour before the performance, Logistics Griff broke into your room and started to question where his money went. Speaking of which, you have to mention another thing. Before you became Guster's performance assistant, it was actually it actuallyA person who is deceiving as a way to make a living, Gust knows this, but is still willing to pursue you, and under his signal, he wants you to cheat Griff money, because when Griff joined the theater, it was just a wine ghost.A rich person, but several times I found that Griff spent a lot of money, which has exceeded the salary in the group, so you have a lot of money through some methods. He himself said that the money is the legacy left by the elders.But now these money can be used to leave the troupe and go to other cities.Because you are just changing the performance suit. In order to leave, you can put on the stool in it. You can only temporarily pass GRIFF, indicating that the performance of the GRIFF "investment" problem can be discussed.Because the audience has entered the field one after another, the outside of the outside world is very complicated, and Griff can't do anything to you, so I have to leave.
When the performance begins, everything is as usual. When you are always at peace, you put Guster into the box, seal the iron chain, finish the acting action that you usually do, and then open the box. Only GUST's corpses appear!His face was embarrassed, his expression was painful, and blood exuded from his neck and hands. The audience was stunned and soon reported to the police.Immediately, everyone in your theater troupe was controlled. Fortunately, you saw the poisonous snake climbing elsewhere along Gust's pants.
Now, you must get rid of the suspicion and then leave the troupe.
