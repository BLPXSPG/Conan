your story
You don’t know who your biological father is. You only know that your name is “A Fu” and that you were born in the 23rd year of Guangxu’s reign in the Qing Dynasty (1897). Your mother works in an orphanage to support you. In order to save rent, she often doesn’t have enough to eat. -You grew up in hunger and cold, suffered from poverty, and longed for money.
When you were 5 years old (1901), your mother became ill due to hard work. Thanks to a "Dr. Zhang" who came to the free clinic for treatment, the condition was temporarily relieved... Later you saw your mother being carried out of the rental house, and you were then sent to Living in an orphanage in a strange and dilapidated environment, I never saw her again - thinking about it now, my mother should have passed away at that time.
You have been in the orphanage since then, and you have seen some orphan girls being picked up and their lives changed, but you have no relatives. When you are sad, you can only run to the riverside and look at the beach in Shanghai - a nightclub with bright lights, rich people and foreigners. Money is spent like water in the racecourse, music and music are heard every night in the theater, and there is endless dancing in the theater every day... Everyone is trying their best to gain wealth and enjoyment, but nothing belongs to you.
In the late spring of the first year of the Republic of China (1912), "Liao Gongzi" wearing a white youth uniform came to the orphanage and provided financial support. The condition was that the director would change the place into "Julie" (Julie) Orphanage - "Liao" "Gongzi" seems to come from another world, attracting everyone's attention... The young female workers in the orphanage are whispering about him, leaving you far behind and feeling lost - it would be great if you could be like him. !
After the orphanage received the money, it expanded its scale, put up a new brand, needed more manpower, and started recruiting. You were already working in the orphanage at that time. You felt that there was too little money here, so you went out to work during the day and came back at night. Sleeping to save money on renting a house, but still unable to save money... The wharf where you work belongs to "Yuanheng Luo Shi" (commercial firm) in Ningbo. The manager is named [Lv Mingran], who is in his thirties. The workers care about their salary, but spend their own money lavishly, which makes people evil. Later, the orphanage was expanded, and the places where boys and girls lived were separated by a new wall, and the employees on both sides were also separated by gender.
Last year (1913), at the end of September, [Lv Mingran] was dismissed and a new manager was appointed.
This year (1914), in September, there seems to be a problem with the business of "Yuanheng Luo", and everyone is owed one month's wages - you can only take the IOU given to you by the dock and return to the orphanage, waiting anxiously for the news. .
On September 13th, you saw [Lv Mingran] in the orphanage. He also recognized you and asked you about a woman named [Xinya]. He also said that [Xinya] was pregnant more than ten years ago. Working here... You are so familiar with the name [Xinya] that you blurt out: "She is my "mother"!"
[Lv Mingran] was shocked after hearing this. He quickly asked your age, and then took you to a "Shui Xuan Restaurant" near the orphanage. He chose a secluded private room. After the wine and food were served, he asked the waiter to go out and close the door - -It's your first time to eat in a restaurant. You swallow your saliva when you look at the dishes in front of you, but you don't dare to move your chopsticks. 【Lv Mingran】Let you eat with peace of mind - this meal is his.
Only then do you dare to eat boldly, and at the same time listen to [Lv Mingran] asking you about your experiences growing up... You answered one by one, and then you remembered that there was a heptagonal one hung around your neck that "mother" left for you. "Copper Pendant" - Do you remember that when "Mom" gave it to you when you were a child, she said it could summon "Manna" and make wishes come true... You told all these things, [Lv Mingran] Look After finishing the "copper pendant", he smiled.
You were full of doubts and asked what the relationship between [Lv Mingran] and "mother" was? [Lv Mingran] I can no longer hold back the joy in my heart and talk about a past event from the year before you were born (1896)...
That year [Lv Mingran] and his friends were fishing on the beach under the cliff on the west side of "Tan Mansion", and suddenly heard a woman shouting. When he looked up, he saw a girl standing on the protruding cliff on the north side of "Tan Mansion", "Mrs. Tan" called her from the "big balcony" on the second floor. The girl turned a deaf ear and jumped into the sea...
[Lv Mingran] said this, paused, and then said that he knew the girl and "Mrs. Tan" - "Mrs. Tan" was named [Luo Mingsha], and he and his sister were good friends who grew up together.
You have become nervous and are anxious to ask the girl who jumped into the sea if she is "mother"? [Lv Mingran] nodded and said that he rowed out to sea and rescued [Xinya], and saw that she was wearing this heptagonal "copper pendant" around her neck... [Xinya] begged not to send her back. , saying that my wife would not forgive her and she would die if she went back...
[Lv Mingran] said that although he felt compassion for her at that time, he could not take her home, so he sent her to a rented house in Pudong - [Lv Mingran] saw [Xinya] suddenly retching on the road, so he asked her to After seeing a doctor, I found out that [Xinya] was pregnant... Later, [Lv Mingran] went to the rental house again and heard that [Xinya] went to work in an orphanage with a pregnant belly in order to make a living... You immediately explain to [Lv Mingran] that the orphanage has not been expanded at that time, there are no dormitories, the employees live outside, the rented houses are dirty and broken, and the sick people can only wait to die... you said Here, when I think of my mother’s death, I hold back my tears, lower my head and eat hard...
[Lv Mingran] After paying the bill, I will send you back to the orphanage and go to the director to confirm your birth year. Before leaving, I asked you not to go out these days. He also said that he will come to you soon - your good days will be soon. arrive!
In the early morning of September 15th, [Lv Mingran] took a car to pick you up from the orphanage and said that he would take you to the home of the owner of "Jicai Medicine". He also said that the owner of "Jicai" [Tan Renchang] was your relative. father! You were surprised and happy. You immediately returned to your residence and put your things in an old cloth bag. When you walked out of the orphanage, you saw [Lv Mingran] and "Liao Gongzi" chatting - [Lv Mingran] nodded and bowed, and after some compliments , before taking you away in a carriage.
You asked [Lv Mingran] about his biological father in the car, and heard him say that your mother [Xinya] was attracted by your father after she married "Mrs. Tan" from Ningbo to Shanghai... Only then did you say that your biological mother was not [Xinya] - [Xinya] took good care of you after your mother passed away, so you called her "Mom", and that "copper pendant" was indeed given to you by [Xinya] - you were In the restaurant, I was worried that if I told the truth, I wouldn’t be able to eat the food and wine... [Lv Mingran] turned pale with fright when he heard this, saying that he had already sworn to [Tan Renchang] We have found our son, but if we find out that he has the wrong person, we will be in big trouble!
You have plans at this time, so tell [Lv Mingran] that [Xinya] became seriously ill two years ago. Her child cannot earn money to treat her illness and cannot even afford to rent a house - you have been there, I learned that [Xinya] and her children were gone... The landlord said it was best for these two to die outside to avoid bringing bad luck to the house!
You suddenly emphasized your tone and said that "that woman" is just like your mother, gone long ago and unimportant - the person [Tan Renchang] needs [Lv Mingran] to take back is the "son" born to him by [Xinya] !
[Lv Mingran] finally understands what you mean, and agrees that you will pretend to be [Xinya]'s son, and only tell the outside world that [Xinya] died long ago, on the condition that you become the heir of the "Tan family" in the future, and you must listen to him!
Not long after you nodded in agreement, the carriage carried you and [Lv Mingran] to the "Tan Mansion". When you saw the tall mansion in front of you, you couldn't help but feel excited - [Lv Mingran] took you up to the second floor, and [Tan Renchang] When you meet (father), there is a gentle and quiet woman next to you - you see her look like a wealthy lady, and your heart beats faster when you think about living under the same roof with her.
[Tan Renchang] was very happy after seeing you. He recognized you as his adopted son on the spot, changed your name to [Cheng Ge] (Tan Cheng Ge), and let you live in the second floor of "Tan Mansion" (Cheng Ge room).
You suddenly transformed into a young master, and you couldn't help but be so excited that you knelt down and called dad... [Lv Mingran] then sent you into the house and told you everything about the "Tan Mansion" - at this time "Mrs. Tan" went back to her natal family in Ningbo. The name of the woman you just saw is [Hai You]. She was originally the niece of [Lv Mingran]'s brother-in-law. Later, she was recognized as the adopted daughter by "Mrs. Tan" and lived in the "house master's house". "Next door (Hai You room) - You are even more happy to hear that [Hai You] has no blood relationship with yourself as the son of [Tan Renchang].
[Lv Mingran] At this time, he mentioned [Tan Renchang]’s nephew, named [Shang Zhi] (Tan Shang Zhi), who lives opposite you (Shang Zhi’s room), and is your cousin, who is 10 years older than you... ····After you keep these words in mind, you throw the old cloth bundle into the bathroom, put on new clothes, and prepare to start a new life - you see [Shang Zhi] coming back with fishing gear, and your father (Tan Renchang) Let him teach you how to read...
In the days that followed, your father took you to a place you had only dreamed of before, to experience the colorful world - you were overwhelmed by the endless pleasures and pleasures, and it was like a dream - you had never seen so many "good things", and the empty " "Foreign wine bottles" were taken home as rare items, and there was no time to learn from [Shang Zhi].
On September 25, "Mrs. Tan" returned to "Tan Mansion", and your father took you to kowtow to her. "Mrs. Tan" seemed to have something on her mind and didn't care about you.
On September 26, you saw "Liao Gongzi" visiting "Tan Mansion" - after his father left, he sent [Lv Mingran] to contact the lawyer, and then took you out in a car with a cheerful face, drinking, having fun, and having fun You didn't come back until very late - you wanted to go find [Hai You], but you were sent back to your room by your father in a daze, and fell asleep.
Yesterday (September 27), you slept until the afternoon. When you got up, your head still hurt from a hangover, so you went to the "pharmacy room" on the third floor to find medicine for headaches. You didn't know the name of the medicine, so you went to get it. Father tells you.
Your father took you to get medicine and told you not to take it on an empty stomach, so you went downstairs to the "kitchen" to eat and saw [Lv Mingran] and a Woman coming to the "Tan Mansion"... "Mrs. Tan" After discussing some matters with [Lv Mingran], [Lv Mingran] went to see his father, and Woman stayed with "Mrs. Tan" - you inquired with the servant and learned that Woman is [Lv Mingran]'s sister "Mrs. Wei", and is also a close friend of "Mrs. Tan".
In the evening, your father wanted to take you and [Lv Mingran] out for drinking again, but because you drank too much yesterday and you were still feeling uncomfortable even though you took medicine, you did not follow him, nor did you go to [Shang Zhi] to learn how to read.
At night, you saw [Lv Mingran] sending your drunken father to the "Family Master's Room" and wanted to say hello, [Lv Mingran] came to the "Cheng Ge Room" to find you, and under the influence of his drunkenness, threatened you that he would wait for you when he came. If you are the heir, you must give him a sum of money, otherwise he will tell [Tan Renchang] the truth... The amount you heard [Lv Mingran] asked for was more painful than cutting flesh from the body, and he could barely squeeze out one I almost broke my teeth when I said "ok" to him!
When it was almost 12 o'clock, [Lv Mingran] left your residence, walked to the opposite door and knocked on the door... You had already regarded "Jicai" as your own property, and you were reluctant to give even a copper plate to it - you afternoon When I was looking for medicine, I already had murderous intentions towards [Lv Mingran] and asked my father if there was any medicine that could make people immobile? Your father pointed out a bottle of "narcotic medicine" to you - you couldn't read, so you remembered the color of the medicine bottle and the label on it.
Today (September 28), at about 9 o'clock, you first went to the "pharmacy room" on the third floor and filled the "narcotics" with the empty "foreign wine bottles" you brought back. Then you went to the "utility room" to take out the rope. Still searching in the "Collection Room" - before you could figure out how to kill [Lv Mingran], you made many preparations.
You then go downstairs to the "kitchen" on the first floor to find something to eat. You see "Liao Gongzi" visiting, and then "Mrs. Tan" opens the door from the "lobby" on the first floor...waiting for you with a I took a plate of "sandwiches" and went upstairs. When I was about to go back to my room to eat, I saw [Lv Mingran] and [Shang Zhi] talking on the second floor.
After you return to your room, eavesdrop through the crack in the door and hear [Lv Mingran] saying that he is going to "Guest Room 2" on the third floor to sleep a little longer, and asking [Shang Zhi] to go to the "kitchen" to get him a "sandwich"... ···Then [Lv Mingran] mentioned "confidentiality" and "conditions"... You were afraid that [Lv Mingran] would tell your secret, so you decided to take action immediately, so you put the "narcotic" on it. In his own "sandwich", he took it out for [Lv Mingran] to eat - [Lv Mingran] took the food and did not go upstairs, but went to the "big balcony" on the second floor to eat - you saw [Lv Mingran] The "big balcony" on the second floor has an inward-facing window, which determines the method of killing. It also requires a long pole, so I thought that [Shang Zhi], who likes fishing, must have a fishing pole in his room.
While [Shang Zhi] is carrying the "sandwich" upstairs to the third floor, go to "Shang Zhi's room" and take out the fishing rod. Go to the "big balcony" on the second floor and see [Lv Mingran] who has already taken effect. he made a noose on both ends of the rope he had prepared earlier, used a fishing rod to put one end through the window, and put it on a chandelier fixed on the roof of the second floor, and then put the other end on [Lv Mingran]'s neck, pushed him out of the window, and hung him above the "lobby" on the first floor... In order to eliminate the evidence of the crime, you put the fishing rod back in the "Shang Zhi's room", closed the door and ran back to yourself residence, pretending to be in the room all the time, and finished eating the "sandwich".
At about 10 o'clock, you vaguely heard a "bumping" sound, and then heard a scream, so you pretended to have just finished eating, walked out of the "Cheng Ge Room", and saw "Mrs. Tan" and "Liao Gongzi" [Shang Zhi] was standing at the staircase on the west side of the corridor on the second floor. "Mrs. Wei" was slumped next to the fence on the east side of the corridor. [Hai You] was supporting her.
You first see a rope hanging from a chandelier. When you lean over the fence and look again, you see a person hanging under the rope. It is actually [Lv Mingran] - [Lv Mingran]'s neck is wrapped in a rope loop, hanging in the air. In the lobby on the first floor, his feet were off the ground and were no longer moving!
"Liao Gongzi" is the calmest person among you. He said to put down the person who was hanging quickly - only then did everyone react and go downstairs from both sides and gather on the first floor...

your secret
Your mother and [Xinya] were co-tenants in the same rented house before she was alive - her mother met [Xinya] when she was working in an orphanage in Pudong - thanks to [Xinya] agreeing to share the house, mother was able to use the only money she had around her That little money will help me find a place to live after I give birth to you.
When you were 5 years old (1901), your mother passed away and you were taken in by an orphanage. You can still see [Xinya] who works in the orphanage every day - [Xinya] has known your mother for many years and treated you in the orphanage. She's so nice that you call her "Mom".
[Xinya] told you a story in the orphanage - a long time ago, there lived a terrible Rakshasa on the mountain by the sea, who could drive the spirit named "Manna" to fulfill wishes... One day, When the maid of Rakshasa put the bird into the bamboo cage, she realized that she had made a big mistake and was afraid of being punished. When she ran away, she took away the pattern that summoned "Manna" and gave it to a strong child to fulfill her wish in the future... ···
Then [Xinya] asked you what you wish for? You answer that you want to live in a big house like those rich people, go to restaurants, and eat a lot of delicious food every day... [Xinya] After listening, he took out the heptagonal "copper pendant" and showed it to you and said As long as you are stronger than other children, she will give you the things in the story - this is a secret that even her daughter does not know... When you no longer cry because you can't see your mother, [Xinya] I really want to give you the "copper pendant" - you remember that there was a new girl in the orphanage at that time, who just lost her mother like you. You wanted to show her the "copper pendant", but She has been picked up...
When you were 16 years old (1912), at the beginning of the year, [Xinya] contracted the same disease as your mother. Her daughter [Hong Er] came to work in the orphanage for her, but the money she earned was not enough to hire a doctor-- The orphanage had not yet been expanded at that time, and you could still see [Hong Er] who took care of the girls. She said that the landlord was afraid that her mother would die in the rental house and wanted to evict them...
In the summer, [Hong Er] suddenly stopped coming. You went to the previous rental house to look for her. I heard that she and [Xinya] were gone. The landlord also said that it was best for the two of them to die outside to avoid bringing bad luck to the house. ······
Today (September 28), in the early morning, you have decided to kill [Lv Mingran]. Just as you were tossing and turning, you heard footsteps outside, so you got out of bed and opened the door, and saw three people in black robes walking Go up the stairs.
It was almost 2 o'clock at this time. You felt uneasy, so you quietly left the room, followed the people upstairs, walked around the beds, furniture and other items moved out from the corridor on the west side of "Guest Room 1", and saw three men in black robes. Entered "Guest Room 1" in sequence.
You hid in the east corner of the "Collection Room" and saw two men in black robes coming out of "Guest Room 1". One went to the "Medicine Room" and the other went to the "Utility Room" - you didn't see clearly. The faces of these three people waited until the two men in black robes returned to "Guest Room 1" with their things, then walked over cautiously, and looked outside the door of "Guest Room 1" to see candlelight in the room - three men in black robes With your back to the door, holding hands, someone is chanting in a low voice... You vaguely hear: "Noble Manna, existing in the soul and the four elements, as well as light and darkness... Please accept Sacrifice, fulfill wishes for Allah (me)…”
You felt a chill and were afraid of being discovered, so you turned around and ran back to the second floor. After entering the "Cheng Ge Room", you calmed down and lay down on the bed.
About an hour later, you heard footsteps again in the quiet night, so you boldly got out of bed and walked to the door. Through the crack in the door, you saw three men in black robes coming down from the third floor. The two behind them were holding hands - -You didn't dare to follow me out anymore, so you lay back on the bed, thinking that what just happened was a nightmare.
At about 9 o'clock, when you went to the third floor to get something, you passed "Guest Room 1" and saw that the door was closed, so you didn't dare to go in... After you took the medicine and rope, you took another handful from the "Collection Room" Sharp Knife... Then you go to "Shang Zhi's Room" to get the fishing rod. When you open the door and go in, you see [Hong Er] - you see she is wearing coarse cloth, like a servant, you immediately guess she is there 【Xinya】With nowhere to go after his death, he came to work at "Tan Mansion"...
Your brain was running rapidly at that moment. You first thought that your identity was not exposed, which meant that neither [Tan Renchang] nor [Hong Er] knew that you were pretending to be [Xinya]'s son - this is what [Xinya] told you before. To be honest, she probably didn’t tell [Hong Er] that “story” until she died... But you have been seen by [Hong Er], and you may be exposed by her at any time and lose everything!
[Hong Er] Sure enough, I recognized you at this time. When she came over to talk, you strangled her with a rope. You were guilty of being a thief, lest anyone pay attention to her appearance, so you used a knife to scratch the face of the corpse, and while the blood was Before it's done, fasten the "mask" in the room... Throw the bloody knife out of the window and lock the window, then come out with the fishing rod, kill [Lv Mingran] and put it away Return to "Shang Zhifang"······

Because we couldn't find a long ladder at the moment, we couldn't put [Lv Mingran]'s body down, so you could only watch him continue to hang in the air.
"Mrs. Tan" turned around and asked [Hai You] if she saw [Cai Qian] and "Liao Gongzi"? [Hai You] thought for a while and said that she saw "Liao Gongzi" going upstairs from the west staircase.
After hearing "Mrs. Tan", you immediately went upstairs from the west staircase - at this time, there were only [Shang Zhi] and [Hai You] around you.
You then heard someone screaming on the second floor, like a woman's voice, and saw [Hai You] and [Shang Zhi] scrambling to go up the stairs on the west side - you were calmer than those two people and heard the scream. Coming from the east side, go up the stairs from the east side and see the door of the "main room" open, and "Mrs. Wei" climbed out of it.
When you reached the second floor, "Mrs. Tan" and [Hai You] had come over to help "Mrs. Wei" - "Mrs. Wei" grabbed "Mrs. Tan" in horror and pointed to the "main room" Trembling, but speechless.
Almost at the same time, a man's shout came from the west side of the corridor on the second floor. You turned your head and saw [Shang Zhi] running out of "Shang Zhi's Room" and almost bumped into "Liao Gongzi" standing at the top of the stairs.
"Liao Gongzi" moved the briefcase in his hand behind him and dodged [Shang Zhi] - [Shang Zhi] leaned weakly against the fence on the second floor and said in a trembling voice: "He (she)... .He (she) is dead!”
"Mrs. Tan" and [Hai You] helped "Mrs. Wei" walk over, and you followed them to the door of "Shang Zhifang"... "Mrs. Wei" suddenly spoke at this time , saying that she just saw the body of [Tan Renchang]!

next story
At noon, the lawyer appointed by [Tan Renchang] came to the "Tan Mansion". After learning that a murder had occurred here, he was shocked and hurriedly reported the matter of the day before yesterday (September 26), [Tan Renchang] sent [Lv Mingran] to find him. Speaking out - it turns out that the lawyer came here today not to help "Mrs. Tan" handle the transfer of the terminal, but to make a "new will" for [Tan Renchang] and change the "beneficiary" of an "insurance".
According to the lawyer, [Tan Renchang] not long ago, when "Mrs. Tan" returned to her natal home, she went to him to make a "will" because she felt unwell and had memory loss. After his death, his nephew [Tan Shang Zhi] inherited properties such as "Jicai" and "Tan Mansion", and there was also a "secret trust" involving part of the property and another heir designated by [Tan Renchang], but the lawyer only You can go to the other party privately, and your name cannot be made public.
In addition, the lawyer could only reveal that when [Lv Mingran] came to him, he asked him if he could make an advance before the heirs received the inheritance? It seems like someone is in a hurry for money.
The lawyer then said that if [Tan Renchang] committed suicide, the "beneficiary" of the insurance policy he purchased would not receive the insurance benefits.
Just after the lawyer finished talking about these things, a valet remembered that he was awakened by the sound of delivering hot water to the second floor early this morning. He walked out of the "valet room" and went to the "lobby" on the first floor to look up. Soon after, he looked up. When the three "men in black robes" walked up to the third floor, another figure followed them up to the third floor. Later, the figure went downstairs from the third floor and went to the west side. The male servant also went back to his room to sleep.
"Mrs. Tan's" personal maid "A Ping" ran over in a hurry and said she saw a dead person in "Guest Room 3" on the third floor... Everyone immediately ran upstairs and opened "Guest Room 3" Behind the door, I saw a Woman lying on the ground, the blood flowing from her head had solidified...
When you see Woman's face, you break into a cold sweat - she is your "mother" [Xinya]!
