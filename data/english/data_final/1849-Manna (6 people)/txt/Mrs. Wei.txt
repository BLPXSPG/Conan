your story
Your full name is [Lv Caiqian]. You were born in the fifth year of Guangxu's reign in the Qing Dynasty (1879). You are originally from Ningbo. Your father (Lv Shouben) works in "Yuanheng Luoshi" (commercial firm). You are conscientious and deeply appreciated by the boss and his family.
When you were 3 years old (1881), your mother (Li Shi) passed away after giving birth to her son [Lv Mingran] (your younger brother). From then on, your father took you and your younger brother's family to live together - your father once took you to your boss's house as a guest , so you met [Mingsha], the daughter of the "Luo family" who is 2 years older than you, and you have played with her since childhood.
When you were 11 years old (1889), [Mingsha]'s brother [Luo Hengli] inherited the "Yuanheng Luo Family" and sent your father to Shanghai as a manager to be responsible for the company's business in Shanghai - your father knew very well that this position was a heavy responsibility. Soon I took you and your brother to work and moved to Shanghai - you thought you would never see [Mingsha] again.
When you were 17 years old (1895), you met [Mingsha] again - "Yuanheng Luo" had a long-term cooperation with "Jicai Medicine Store" in Shanghai. Your father once took you to the "Tan Mansion" where she lived to attend a reception. , and later the young master of "Jicai" [Tan Renchang] followed the orders of his parents and married [Mingsha].
Your father took you to visit "Tan Mansion" after their wedding. When you met [Mingsha] who had become "Mrs. Tan" - [Mingsha] still remembered you and kept inviting you to "Tan Mansion" since then.
In addition to [Mingsha], you also met the maid [Xinya] she brought from Ningbo--[Xinya] is the same age as you. I heard from her that [Mingsha] often took her to spend the night in the house next to the "main house" after marriage. .
A year later (1896), when you were a guest, you accidentally learned that [Tan Renchang]’s mother was dissatisfied with [Mingsha] not being pregnant...
One day, [Mingsha] asked you and [Xinya] to play a Western game with her - [Mingsha] asked you to stay. In the early morning of the next day, she took you and [Xinya] to the house next to the "main house". Take a bath, put on a black robe, draw a "seven-cornered array" on the ground, write symbols you can't understand, light the seven candles placed on the seven corners of the array, and let [Xinya] kill a bird , put the corpse in the "Seven-Cornered Array", then hold your and [Xinya]'s hands, and chant in a low voice - you vaguely heard: "Noble Manna, exists in the soul and the four elements, as well as light and Secretly...please accept the sacrifice and fulfill your wish for Allah (me)..."
When the candles burn out, the "game" ends.
After daybreak, you said your goodbyes and left. In the following days, you never went to "Tan Mansion" again. You didn't know that something big happened there...
As the Shanghai manager of "Yuanheng Luo", my father was also responsible for taking care of [Mingsha]. He suddenly had to rush back to Ningbo... You quickly asked what happened, and then you heard that [Mingsha] was with you After leaving "Tan Renchang" that day, she actually said curse words to [Tan Renchang]'s parents, and then [Xinya] jumped into the sea and committed suicide!
[Tan Renchang]'s mother witnessed this scene on the "balcony corridor" on the third floor. After being frightened, she fell ill and passed away... The "Tan family" naturally blamed all this [Mingsha] !
My father returned to Ningbo just to help [Mingsha] move reinforcements - [Luo Hengli] was strong and loved [Mingsha]. "Yuanheng Luo" and "foreign friends" quickly put the matter to rest and did not let [Mingsha] 】Suffering a loss...[Tan Renchang]'s father sulked and became bedridden.
The following year (1897), [Mingsha] introduced you to a young master of the "Wei family" (Wei Yangyao) who had business dealings with the "Yuanheng Luo family" as your husband. He watched you enter the marriage hall and became "Mrs. . Wei".
Every time you and your husband went to "Tan Mansion" to visit, [Mingsha] was reluctant to let you go, leaving you and your husband to live in "Guest Room 2" on the third floor. She kept you talking until nightfall, then reluctantly watched you go to the hotel. Upstairs - If your husband leaves for something, [Mingsha] will go upstairs and spend the night with you, just like she did when she was a child.
A few years later (1901), your father-in-law and mother-in-law passed away successively. Your husband brought back a 9-year-old little girl, saying that she was his distant niece named [Hai You]. She was sent to the hospital after her parents died. An orphanage in Pudong, I finally got in touch with him... Your husband and you don’t have a child yet. He wanted to adopt [Hai You], so he took her home from the orphanage, but you didn’t like this sudden appearance. little girl.
Later, you and your husband took [Hai You] to the "Tan Mansion" as a guest. After telling her life experience, [Mingsha] hugged [Hai You] - [Hai You] started crying and said [Mingsha] Remind her of her mother... [Mingsha] recognized [Hai You] as her adopted daughter on the spot, so you naturally had no objection, so you left [Hai You] in the "Tan Mansion", and [Mingsha] let her live in " Next door to the main house (Hai Youfang).
From then on, you often saw [Mingsha] and [Hai You] getting intimate together. Obviously they were both happier than you - your marriage at that time was becoming a mess, but you didn't want [Mingsha] or [Hai You] to know. -A husband took charge of the household after his parents-in-law passed away. He was already a heavy smoker and indulged himself in opium dens or card games all day long. He didn’t care about his own business and only wanted to spend money...
After you were disappointed with your husband, you only hoped that your younger brother would succeed - you have always been concerned about your younger brother's lifelong events and hoped that he would get married soon.
A few years later (1904), [Mingsha], like you, still had no children, so [Tan Renchang] brought the son of his deceased relative, his nephew [Shang Zhi], to the "Tan Mansion" to let him Living on the second floor (Shang Zhi's room) for him to study - you heard from his father that [Luo Hengli] introduced a teacher to [Shang Zhi].
After that, your life did not get better. When you were 30 years old (1908), you became more and more irritable. Once when you stayed overnight at the "Tan Mansion", you saw your husband leaving early, and you were left by [Mingsha] to chat with her until late, and you felt depressed in your heart. Unbearable, when I went upstairs to rest, I lost my temper outside my home for the first time in my life without telling [Mingsha], on the pretext that I was worried about [Hai You] being bullied.
When you were 31 years old (1909), your father passed away. You begged [Mingsha] to write to her brother so that he could inherit his father's business and continue to be the Shanghai manager of "Yuanheng Luo".
After a while, [Mingsha] returned to Ningbo to visit her brother, and you went to "Tan Mansion" every day to inquire about news until [Mingsha] was sent back to Shanghai by [Luo Hengli] - not long after, "Yuanheng Luo" Appoint your brother to take over as manager and manage the Shanghai business.
Last year (1913), at the end of September, [Luo Hengli] actually removed your brother and replaced him with a new manager - your brother had no real estate in Shanghai and lived in your home (the Wei family) after leaving "Yuanheng Luo" , complaining that he did nothing wrong and someone must have framed him... You went to "Tan Mansion" for help about your brother's unemployment. After hearing about it, [Tan Renchang] arranged for him to be sent to "Jicai" "When I do things at home, I always take him with me when I go out.
In August of this year (1914), my husband heard some gossip about "Yuanheng Luo" and told him after returning home - it turned out that [Luo Hengli] had borrowed money from a business group, and the collateral was "Yuanheng Luo" "For the docks and land in Shanghai, I heard that the repayment deadline is coming...
On September 5th, when you were chatting with [Mingsha] at "Tan Mansion", you told her the gossip you heard - [Mingsha] was shocked after hearing it. A few days later, [Mingsha] took her with her My personal maid (A Ping) took a boat from Shanghai back to her hometown in Ningbo.
Of course you know that [Mingsha] has relied on the power of her natal family to maintain her privileged position in the "Tan family" over the years. Once "Yuanheng Luoshi" goes bankrupt, [Mingsha] will lose everything! [Mingsha] After leaving, you were also very concerned about the news in Ningbo and came to "Tan Mansion" every day to wait for her return.
On September 15th, you saw your younger brother bringing a boy to the "Tan family". [Tan Renchang] was very happy after meeting them. He recognized the boy as his adopted son on the spot and named him [Cheng Ge] (Tan Cheng Ge). and let him live in the second floor (Cheng Ge Room) of "Tan Mansion".
After you got home, you asked your brother about the boy's origin. Your brother said that he met the boy in a "Julie" (Julie) orphanage in Pudong, so he took him to "Tan Mansion"...you I can see that my brother is not telling the truth, but he said that this matter is related to the "boss"'s private secret and he cannot tell you.
On September 25th, [Mingsha] finally returned to Shanghai, but you had already left "Tan Mansion" that day. You didn't wait for her. When your brother came home, you heard him tell you about the incident and a shocking news: it turns out that [Mingsha]'s My brother has passed away in Ningbo! [Luo Hengli] In order to raise money to repay the loan, he hurriedly sold all the businesses of "Yuanheng Luo" in Wuhan - since then, "Yuanheng Luo" has existed in name only, and there is only one dock left in Shanghai... ·
The younger brother has always been dissatisfied with the dismissal. After saying this, he gloated and said that although "Yuanheng Luo" had paid off the loan that mortgaged the dock, it still owed a large sum of compensation for breach of contract. This time, "Luo Family" "There must be no escape!" At this time, your husband teased your brother and said, didn’t he sign all these contracts in the first place? The younger brother immediately said that there were no problems with the contracts when they were signed, and that the breach of contract and compensation were all matters after he was dismissed - [Luo Hengli] did not mention these things when he was dismissed from his position, so it must have nothing to do with him!
Yesterday (September 27th), [Mingsha] asked someone to come to your house to invite your brother to discuss, so you accompanied him to the "Tan Mansion", only to find out that [Mingsha] planned to use the pier to pay off debts, and was worried about the pier. The value is not worth the compensation, but your brother can’t estimate the value of the dock... You have never seen [Mingsha] so anxious, so you stayed with her...
[Mingsha] After thinking hard for a long time, she suddenly asked you and [Hai You] to play a Western game with her - you immediately remembered what happened back then - the venue at that time has now become the "Hai You Room", and [Mingsha] Choose the larger "Guest Room 1" on the third floor, and send [Hai You] to tell the maid to move all the furniture out of "Guest Room 1" and find an animal to put in...
[Tan Renchang] took your brother out for a drink in the afternoon. Before he came back after dark, the maid said that there were people in "Guest Room 2" and "Guest Room 3" on the third floor, so [Mingsha] asked you to stay in the "Hai You Room" for the night.
Today (September 28), in the early morning, [Mingsha] came to "Hai You's room" to wake you and [Hai You] up, and told "A Ping" to find someone to send hot water to your respective rooms - the three of you. Take a shower first, then put on the black robe that [Mingsha] brought, and go upstairs together - [Mingsha] walks in front, and you and [Hai You] follow her around the corridor on the west side of "Guest Room 1". After entering the "Guest Room 1" where the furniture had been emptied, I saw a little bird in a birdcage in the room.
When it was almost 2 o'clock in the morning, [Mingsha] asked [Hai You] to go to the "utility room" to find a match and seven candles, while she went to the "pharmacy room" to get cinnabar and brought back "guest room one". The same "seven-cornered array" was drawn on the ground... Waiting for [Hai You] to get the things back, [Mingsha] placed the candles in the corresponding positions as usual, lit them with a few matches, and then let [Hai You] Kill the bird and put the body in the "seven-cornered array" - you have the last experience, so you take the initiative to reach out to [Mingsha] and hear the chant again...
At about 3 o'clock in the morning, the candles finally burned out, and [Mingsha] took you and [Hai You] away - you followed [Mingsha], feeling vaguely uneasy, and when you were going downstairs after passing through the corridor, you were pulled from behind. Stopping your hand, you were so frightened that you turned around and breathed a sigh of relief when you saw it was [Hai You]...
【Hai You】holds your hand tightly and asks you in a low voice what the "game" you just said meant? You shook your head and said you didn't know - you could feel that [Hai You] was also scared, so you took her back to "Hai You's room" - after you entered the room, you went to the bathroom in the room and quickly He took off his black robe, put it on the tub, washed his face, and when he came out, he saw that [Hai You] had taken off his black robe and went to bed.
You also went to bed, lying next to [Hai You], closing your eyes... and not sleeping soundly.
At about 9 o'clock, you hear a knock on the door next door, get out of bed quickly, open the door a crack, and see [Mingsha] who has changed clothes come out of the "main room", and "A Ping" outside the door says to her, "Liao" "Gongzi" is already here... [Mingsha] hurried down the stairs next to the "main room" after hearing this. [Hai You] also woke up at this time, so you take her to the bathroom in the room. We dressed up together and then changed our clothes.
At about 10 o'clock, you heard the sound of "bang" and [Hai You] said that he was going to the "house master's room" to say hello.
You heard [Hai You] scream after she went out. You followed her out immediately and saw [Hai You] standing by the stairs, shaking all over. You walked to [Hai You] and first saw a rope hanging from a chandelier. You went to the fence and leaned over to look again. You saw a person hanging under the rope. It was your brother [Lv Mingran] - his brother's neck. He was caught in a rope loop and hung in the lobby on the first floor. His feet were off the ground and he was no longer moving!
You were so scared that you collapsed on the ground, [Hai You] hurriedly supported you, and then you noticed a "young man" and [Mingsha] [Shang Zhi] standing at the stairs on the west side of the second floor corridor, [Cheng Ge] Walked out of the "Cheng Ge Room"... The "young man" is the calmest one among you. He said to put down the person who was hanging up quickly - only then did everyone react and go downstairs from both sides. , gathered on one floor...

Act 2:
your secret
You knew [Tan Renchang] long before he married [Mingsha], and have had an affair ever since.
When you first arrived in Shanghai, you dressed up carefully and wore a newly bought dress. Your father took you to the "Tan Mansion" for a cocktail party. In the "lobby" on the first floor, you met [Tan Renchang], who was one year older than you - you were at that time We were all teenagers, so we hid together in a garden without adults and had a lot of fun. [Tan Renchang] also invited you to ride horses with him at the foreigner's "racetrack"... Unfortunately, you were soon The father found it and took it home.
In the days that followed, you always looked forward to going to "Tan Renchang" again. Every time your father took you to an appointment, you would look for opportunities to get along with [Tan Renchang], but you never had the chance to go to the "Tan Renchang" appointment with him. You can only see him riding a white horse to your house in your dream to pick you up for your appointment...
When you were 17 years old (1895), you followed your father to the "Tan Mansion" for an appointment again, and deliberately put on the most beautiful clothes. Unexpectedly, this time it was the wedding of [Tan Renchang] and [Mingsha] - you were at the beginning of the wedding You ran away crying before, and no one noticed you - it's obvious that you and [Tan Renchang] met first, and you really want to fall in love!
You dare not offend [Mingsha], let alone let her realize that you love her husband. Every time you receive an invitation, you must rush to the "Tan Mansion" immediately and continue to be [Mingsha]'s playmate - you and [Tan Renchang] truly fell in love first, and the relationship did not disappear after his marriage. On the contrary, it became even more intense because of [Mingsha]'s existence.
When [Mingsha] asked you to play that "game" with her for the first time, you heard the chant mentioning wish fulfillment, and immediately thought of [Tan Renchang], repeated it secretly and made a wish, hoping that the "Tan family" would abandon [ Mingsha】·····After daybreak, you will find the opportunity to tell [Tan Renchang] these things - [Tan Renchang] is overjoyed when he hears this, saying that he can divorce [Mingsha] and marry you - you are full of expectations , hugged [Tan Renchang], and then left "Tan Renchang" reluctantly... When your father returned to Ningbo, you sent your younger brother to "Tan Renchang" to inquire, and learned that [Mingsha] had been with [Mingsha]. Tan Renchang] separated, and before she had time to be happy, the incident that caused [Tan Renchang]'s mother to die of fright was quickly resolved due to the strong intervention of [Luo Hengli].
Until you get married, [Tan Renchang] will never rest [Mingsha]... You are unwilling to give in. Fortunately, after marriage, you can more conveniently go to "Tan Renchang" as a guest - although you are accompanied by your husband, you You and [Tan Renchang] still found a way to avoid being noticed... Every time you and your husband stayed at the "Tan Mansion", you would chat with [Mingsha] until very late before going upstairs - your husband was a big smoker. , lack of energy, has long been resting in "Guest Room 2", [Tan Renchang] sometimes makes an excuse to go out, but actually goes to the third floor to wait for you to go upstairs.
After you walked up to the third floor alone for the first time, you heard [Tan Renchang] calling you softly in the "study". You immediately walked in and was led into the "collection room" further inside - [Tan Renchang] sent you Give you a "golden key", then hold your hand and the key, lead you to open a secret lock in the room, open the shelf that serves as a secret door, walk into a secret room, and see a big bed inside. Suddenly your face turned red... [Tan Renchang] said that there is a soundproof layer here for you to have fun... Afterwards, you only need to hide it from your husband. When he asks you, you just say that you were [ Mingsha] Stay and chat - the only trouble is that sometimes your husband doesn't want to stay overnight. Once he says goodbye and leaves, [Mingsha] will come upstairs to spend the night with you, causing [Tan Renchang] to wait in vain...
Since [Hai You] went to "Tan Renchang", [Mingsha] has spent a lot of time with her, which gave you more opportunities to get along with [Tan Renchang] - until 1908, you saw [Hai You] went downstairs from the third floor disheveled and crying - although [Tan Renchang] kept explaining that he didn't do anything, you still couldn't hold back your anger and lost your temper at him on the pretext that you were worried about [Hai You] being bullied.
Every time [Mingsha] returns to Ningbo, you find reasons to go to "Tan Mansion" every day. When you don't see [Mingsha] come back, you pretend to say goodbye. In fact, you quietly go to the third floor, use the key to open the secret lock, and meet [Mingsha] waiting inside. Tan Renchang】Rekindle an old relationship--【Tan Renchang】I always feel reluctant to leave you, and I promise to see you again tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.
Last year (1913), [Tan Renchang] heard that your brother had been removed by [Luo Hengli], so he placed him in "Jicai" and regarded him as a close confidant - naturally to make you happy.
Today (September 28), when [Mingsha] asked you to play that "game" with her again, after you heard the low voice chanting, you immediately repeated it and made a wish secretly, hoping that there would be no more "Tan Renchang" around you. Other women...

Because we couldn't find a long ladder at the moment and couldn't put down my brother's body, you could only watch his dead body continue to hang in the air.
You lost your brother who you watched grow up. You were extremely sad and needed someone to comfort you, so you went upstairs from the east side when no one was paying attention - you wanted to tell [Tan Renchang] that [Lv Mingran] was dead and let him Hug you and help you find the truth...
You walked into the "main room" and saw that the bathroom and bed were empty, so you continued to the "small balcony". When you opened the door, you saw [Tan Renchang] wearing underwear, sitting cross-legged on a couch, facing the north-- You took another step forward and came to the "small balcony". You turned to look at [Tan Renchang]'s face, and then you saw clearly that a sharp awl had been inserted into [Tan Renchang]'s chest, and the blood that flowed out had solidified... ·····You trembled and put your hand under [Tan Renchang]’s nose, and found that he was no longer breathing!
You screamed in fright, and before you could take a closer look at the body, you ran back into the "main house" and crawled out of it... You were still in shock when you crawled outside the door, [Mingsha] [Hai You] came from the west side of the corridor on the second floor to help you up, and [Cheng Ge] also walked up the east stairs to the second floor at this time - you held on to [Mingsha] tightly and pointed at the "main house", trembling. , being too frightened to say anything.
Almost at the same time, a man's shout came from the west side of the corridor on the second floor, which brought you back to your senses. You saw [Shang Zhi] running out of "Shang Zhi's room" and almost bumped into "Shang Zhi" standing at the top of the stairs. "Liao Gongzi".
"Liao Gongzi" moved the briefcase in his hand behind him and dodged [Shang Zhi] - [Shang Zhi] leaned weakly against the fence on the second floor and said in a trembling voice: "He (she)... .He (she) is dead!”
[Mingsha] and [Hai You] helped you walk over, and [Cheng Ge] followed you, and together they came to the door of "Shang Zhifang"... At this time, you finally calmed down and said that you just saw it 【Tan Renchang】’s corpse!

Act 3:
next story
At noon, the lawyer appointed by [Tan Renchang] came to the "Tan Mansion". After learning that a murder had occurred here, he was shocked and hurriedly reported the matter of the day before yesterday (September 26), [Tan Renchang] sent [Lv Mingran] to find him. Speaking out - it turns out that the lawyer came here today not to help [Mingsha] handle the transfer of the terminal, but to make a "new will" for [Tan Renchang] and change the "beneficiary" of an "insurance".
According to the lawyer, [Tan Renchang] not long ago, that is, when [Mingsha] returned to her parents' home, she asked him to make a "will" because she felt unwell and had memory loss. In addition to the properties such as "Jicai" and "Tan Mansion" inherited by the nephew [Tan Shang Zhi], there is also a "secret trust" involving part of the property and another heir designated by [Tan Renchang], but the lawyer can only privately Go down and find the other party, and the name of the other party cannot be made public.
In addition, the lawyer could only reveal that when [Lv Mingran] came to him, he asked him if he could make an advance before the heirs received the inheritance? It seems like someone is in a hurry for money.
The lawyer then said that if [Tan Renchang] committed suicide, the "beneficiary" of the insurance policy he purchased would not receive the insurance benefits.
Just after the lawyer finished talking about these things, a valet remembered that he was awakened by the sound of delivering hot water to the second floor early this morning. He walked out of the "valet room" and went to the "lobby" on the first floor to look up. Soon after, he looked up. When the three "men in black robes" walked up to the third floor, another figure followed them up to the third floor. Later, the figure went downstairs from the third floor and went to the west side. The male servant also went back to his room to sleep.
[Mingsha]'s personal maid "A Ping" hurriedly ran over and said that she saw a dead person in "Guest Room Three" on the third floor... Everyone immediately ran upstairs and opened the door of "Guest Room Three" Behind the door, I saw a Woman lying on the ground, the blood flowing from her head had solidified...
You feel that Woman looks familiar, but because you are constantly frightened by the death of people around you, your mind is confused and you can't remember where you have seen her...
