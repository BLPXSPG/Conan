background story
September 4, the third year of the Republic of China (1914 AD) (the fifteenth day of the seventh lunar month)
After Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty abdicated, the "Beiyang Government" established its capital in Beijing, and Yuan Shikai became president. The Western powers are busy on the European battlefield and have no time to look eastward. China seems to be ushering in a new situation.
In Guangdong Province in the south, there is the "Guangsan Railway", which was completed and opened to traffic in 1903. It connects Guangzhou and Foshan to the "Sanshuihekou Station". Get off the train here, then cross the "Xijiang" to the west, and then enter a Luxurious Mountains - One of them is "Baoshu Town" hidden in the mountains and forests. The entrance of the town is nearly 2 hours' walk from the ferry of "Xijiang". There is only one road leading in and out of the town. The population of the town is concentrated in the center of the town. Among them, the "Ge family" has the largest business - the head of the family, Ge Jixian, has served as the town's mayor. "Bao Chang" gave birth to two daughters. The eldest daughter, Ge Yueman, married away from Tianjin. The younger daughter, Ge Yueluo, was left behind and hired Zhu Lingshan, a foreigner, as his son-in-law.
Three months ago, Ge Jixian was kidnapped by bandits, and only a corpse with its right ear cut off, all teeth missing, and hands and feet broken was found. It was so horrific... Ge Yueluo was distraught and angered the whole world. House slaves, drive these people out of the "Ge family"...
At that time, no one could have thought that this was just the beginning of the tragedy in "Baoshu Town" - it all started on September 1, three days ago. ． ． ． ． ．

Act 1:
your story
(Please do not read the script directly during the game. When acting, you must conform to the character's personality. You can add content that is not written in the script on the basis that it does not violate the character setting)
Your name is [Yu Yancheng]. You were born in the 20th year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty (1896). You were originally from Guangxi. You left your hometown when you were 4 years old (1899). Your brother [Yu Shangyong] brought you to "Baoshu Town" and lived in the town. Brother Dong goes out to hunt every day and takes care of you when you grow up. You brothers have no relatives in the town and can only depend on each other.
When you were 6 years old (1901), the "Ge family", a big family in the town, summoned all the hunters in the town to hunt in the "Wild Deer Forest". Your brother also joined them and went to the west of the town. You were bitten by a poisonous snake outside your home that day. When your brother came back, you had developed a high fever and your life was hanging by a thread. Thanks to the nearby Orion [Afa] for telling your brother some life-saving news: [Zhang Junshi] who lives near "Baoshu Pagoda" once studied medicine abroad and happened to come back to town recently.
Your brother ran to the "Zhang Family" to ask for help. [Zhang Junshi] rushed to your home with his assistant to diagnose, treat and prepare medicine for you (a kind of "Lobelia" grows on the bank of "Lotus River" not far from your home. Together with the Western medicine brought by Zhang Junshi, he prepared a life-saving medicine on the spot. medicine)...you just saved a life. After you fully recovered, your brother took you to the "Zhang Family" to express your gratitude, but you didn't meet your benefactor - [Zhang Junshi] who had already left "Baoshu Town" and went to Shanghai at that time.
You brothers owed the "Zhang family" a great favor from then on. Until [Zhang Junshi]'s parents passed away, there was no chance to repay. Your brother sometimes went hunting in the "Wild Deer Forest" far away from home, just to pass by. Take a look at it when you were in the "Zhang Family" - Later you went hunting with your brother, traveling all over the mountains in and outside the town, and developed a good "gun" (shotgun) and the skills of butchering and skinning prey - you liked to kill the prey Tie it to the "gun" and carry it on your shoulder, as if showing off.
There is a "Lü's Tavern" near your home. Every time your brother finishes hunting, he would pick some fresh food and send it to him in exchange for copper coins. Later, you also went there to send game meat to sell for money, and met the owner of the tavern [Lü Songnian]. And [Uncle Zhu] (Zhu Lingshan) who often goes to the pub - [Uncle Zhu], like your brothers, is from Guangxi. He sometimes invites you to drink with him. You don’t have a good capacity for drinking, so you don’t dare to drink more, so you just watch [Uncle Zhu] drink one glass after another. - [Uncle Zhu] doesn’t talk much on weekdays, but is always frowning, as if he is feeling unspeakably aggrieved. , must be swallowed by wine... You heard that [Uncle Zhu] is the son-in-law of the bride-in-law. No one in the family regards him as a uncle, and his wife is very difficult to take care of (you are young, how do you know this kind of thing between parents-in-law? Hearing this, he could only blush and nod)... [Uncle Zhu] After getting drunk, he finally spoke his mind. He said that he didn’t care what others thought, but he was thinking more and more about his “good wife” now. (Maybe it was his wife), but it was a pity that everything was too late. If he could do it over again, he would be willing to die... After that, the drunk [Uncle Zhu] was helped by the tavern owner [Lü Songnian] to rest in the backyard of the tavern.
On June 7 this year (1914), your brother discovered the body of [Ge Jixian] in the "Wild Deer Forest" - he was hung from a tree, his right ear was cut off, his teeth were all missing, and his hands and feet were broken. ····· Based on many years of hunting experience, the elder brother could tell that the person had been dead for several days - he didn’t know what kind of enemy the “Ge family” had encountered, and how cruel it was!
At the end of June, you met [Uncle Zhu] again, and he asked you for help - it turned out that his wife went crazy at home and drove away all the servants. Among them was a woman named [Le Wan] who had no place to go. [Uncle Zhu] wants to find a place for her to stay. There happens to be a spare room in your house. You tell your brother about it and he agrees to rent it to [Le Wan].
[Uncle Zhu] took out three months’ rent, and your brother wanted more. [Uncle Zhu] said three months was enough... After that, [Uncle Zhu] drove a carriage and sent [Le Wan] to Your family - [Le ​​Wan] is a diligent woman. When she came, she helped with the cooking, cooking the game very delicious, and washing and mending your brothers' clothes. You were surprised to find that having a woman in your family was so different!
Soon after, you brothers finally met your savior [Zhang Junshi] - two months ago (July), [Zhang Junshi] brought his wife (Mrs. Zhang) back to town, and he also brought a brand new car The "car" caused a sensation by allowing his wife to travel around town. Your brother took you to the "Zhang Family" to say thanks. [Zhang Junshi] also remembered you, and instead thanked your brother for helping him take care of his parents' gravesites when he left town.
At the end of July, [Le Wan] suddenly left without saying goodbye. Your brother went to the town to look for her. When he came back, he told you that [Le Wan] had another place to live, and he would send the things she left there.
Later, [Zhang Junshi] left the town for work. You passed by the "Zhang Family" and saw many "sealing buckets" (with warnings of "Keep away from fire" posted on them) being unloaded outside the door. [Mrs. Zhang] was worried. You helped move all these things into the warehouse. As a thank you, [Mrs. Zhang] invited you to have afternoon tea at her house, and made a reservation for daily game with you. From then on, you went hunting in the "Wild Deer Forest" every day before dawn. After that, I happily send you to the "Zhang Family". After [Mrs. Zhang] pays, you will be left to have some snacks at the "Zhang Family" before leaving.
On the morning of August 30th, when you were delivering game to [Mrs. Zhang], you heard that her niece was coming from Guangzhou to visit her. You offered to ask your brother to go to Guangzhou to help pick her up - your brother will come to Guangzhou at the end of every month. I went to Guangzhou with a few hunters to sell fur goods, and I was very familiar with the roads to and from Guangzhou. [Mrs. Zhang] I am very happy. I wrote a handwritten letter to you, saying that when they cross the "Xijiang River", she will drive to the ferry to pick them up. You regard this as the top priority to repay your kindness. You will tell your brother when you get home. He nodded. Agree, and tell you to be careful in the town. In the afternoon, take the letter and the animal skins and go to Guangzhou with others.
On September 1st, Orion, who went to Guangzhou with your brother, returned to town and brought you a message - your brother is staying in Guangzhou, waiting to be picked up. Regardless of the hot weather, you immediately ran to the "Zhang Family", wanting to tell [Mrs. Zhang] the news in person, but you saw [Le Wan] - she said that [Mrs. Zhang] went to the "Ge Family", so you invited [Mrs. Zhang] to the "Ge Family". [Le Wan] took you to the "Ge Family".


Act 2:
On the afternoon of September 1st, you returned home and saw that it was still early, so you took your "gun" and went hunting in the nearby "Abandoned Fort" - you heard people in the town say that more than fifty years ago, the Qing Dynasty was shaken by half of the country. The "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" fell apart due to internal strife. Some of them fled to "Baoshu Town", where they were discovered by the government and led troops. "Abandoned Fort" was the last place where the remainder of the "Taiping Army" was stationed.
Today's "abandoned castles" live up to their name, with only ruins left for foxes and rabbits to lurk - it takes you some time to catch the prey (your "gun" is different from a modern shotgun, you need to refill the gunpowder after each shot, Insert iron pellets, so your brother taught you to reload immediately after every shot to develop a habit to avoid missing prey). You cut the dead beast clean on the spot and took the fresh meat to the "Lu Family Tavern" to sell it. Unexpectedly, the tavern closed early before nightfall.
You saw that it was getting dark, so you had to take the fresh meat to the "Huangji Fresh Meat Shop" in the west of the town. When you passed the east of the town, you saw [Mrs. Zhang]'s car parked on the side of the road, but you didn't see her.
When you went to the butcher shop to sell fresh meat, you argued with the boss about the price. It took a long time to reach an agreement. It was already very late outside. On your way home, you saw someone passing by carrying a coffin and quickly got out of the way. road.
On September 2nd, you got up early and went to burn incense on the "ancestral tablets". After that, you went hunting in the "Wild Deer Forest" as usual. Then you tied the fresh game to the "gun" and sent it to the "Zhang Family", but you heard that [Mrs. Zhang] only came back to pick up things after evening yesterday, and then left in a hurry. She didn't go home all night, and [Le Wan] wasn't there either.
You handed the game to the servants of the "Zhang Family" and walked back to the east of the town. When you passed the "Lu Family Tavern", you saw that they still didn't open the door. After noon, you climbed up the mountain located downstream (to the west) of the "Lotus Stream" to hunt, and saw [Mrs. Zhang] driving away from the town alone from a distance.
You firmly believe that hunting depends on luck (you brothers worship the "ancestral tablets" every day to ask for blessings from your ancestors) - you were unlucky that day, and it took you the whole afternoon to shoot a "bamboo" on the mountain near the "town entrance" "Raccoon dog" (a common prey here), wait for you to cut it open on the spot, it will be dark soon - then you see two lights at the "town entrance" from a distance, which should be [Mrs. Zhang]'s car lights.
After you come down the mountain, you still go to the "Lu Family Tavern" first. Seeing that the door of the tavern is locked from the outside (you guessed that the tavern is closed all afternoon), you go to the "Huangji Fresh Meat Shop".
You sold today's prey and were waiting for the butcher shop owner to pay, when you caught a glimpse of a carriage passing by outside the door of the butcher shop. You recognized it at a glance as the carriage of the "Ge family" - [Uncle Zhu] always drove it. The carriage of the "Ge family", when he sent [Le Wan] to the "Yu family", he also drove this carriage and let [Le Wan] sit in the carriage.
After you got the money from selling the prey, you hurried to the "Ge family" and wanted to ask [Uncle Zhu] where he had been these past few days (everyone looked for him everywhere yesterday but didn't see him).
You came to the door of "Ge's House" and saw the carriage parked outside. You ran in front of the carriage and saw that the driver had left. Then you heard a noise in the carriage.
You walked around from the front of the carriage to the back of the carriage and saw a [young man] (Xue Yufan) rolling out of the carriage and falling to the ground!
You immediately ran over to help the [young man] up and saw that he looked similar to [Xue Dacai]. The material of his clothes was very good, but his body was tied up with a rope, so you immediately pulled out the hunting knife you brought with you and cut the rope for him - you At that time, I noticed that the second shopkeeper of "Lü's Tavern" [Lü Lusheng] (he looked similar to Lü Songnian) was standing near the carriage.
You see that [the young man] is very weak at this time and can't stand firmly, so he helps him into the "Ge Family" - [Lü Lusheng] follows behind.
The hall of "Ge Family" has been decorated as a mourning hall, with candlelight swaying. [Le Wan] and [Mrs. Zhang] are also here - [Young Man] seemed to have regained some strength at this time, and he asked [Lü Lusheng] about this place Where is it, [Lu Lu
Sheng] told him that this was the "Ge family" and that the [young man's] father (Xue Dacai) came yesterday. You didn't see [Uncle Zhu], but you saw a woman (Ge Yueman) walking down from the second floor - she had short hair and was wearing a Western dress that you couldn't buy in town. Her appearance was similar to [Ge Yueluo]'s, and her temperament But completely different...
The day before yesterday (September 2) 20:30 ("Ge's" "living room") greetings


Act 3:
You are now playing [Yu Yancheng]’s brother [Yu Shangyong] - you are tall and cautious,
I went to Guangzhou before and only returned to town on September 3.
The previous content was all what [Yu Yancheng] told you after you returned home, and it happened a few days ago.
your story
You were born in the seventh year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty (1881), originally from Guangxi. You and your younger brother Yu Yancheng are both the sons of the fierce bandit "Chao Hu King" - the real name of "Chao Hu King" is [Wang Hu Dynasty]. At first, he traveled across Guangxi and Guangxi, killing and looting. , has always been a serious problem for local officials, and the reward is as high as a thousand taels of silver.
In 1899, Guangdong and Guangxi worked together to suppress the bandits. The "Chao Tiger King" suffered heavy losses and did not dare to return to his hometown, so he fled to "Baoshu Town" to look for his old subordinates, and asked you to take your younger brother to find him in your hometown (you have never done this Bandit), when you rushed to "Baoshu Town" with your 4-year-old little brother in your arms and the "ancestral memorial tablets", the "Chao Tiger King" had already been captured, and the "Bao Chang" at that time executed him on the spot! You wouldn't have thought that your father, who was skilled in martial arts, would be easily arrested, but you didn't dare to inquire about it, so you could only feel sad in secret.
From then on, you lied about your surname as "Yu" (you changed the word "王" on the tablet), lived in a secluded place in the east of the town, relied on the martial arts you had practiced since childhood, and brought the "gun" your father gave you (you The "guns" used by the brothers are all passed down from ancestors). He goes hunting in the nearby mountains every day and takes care of his younger brother. To the outside world, he only says that he is here to escape. There is a "Lujia Tavern" not far from your residence. The owner is not like Zhenxirou. The shop is so fussy about everything, so you often pick up some fresh game and send it over in exchange for copper coins.
In 1901, you were recruited by the "Ge Family" to round up deer cubs in the "Wild Deer Forest". Your younger brother stayed at home and was bitten by a poisonous snake and developed a high fever. It was all thanks to [Zhang Junshi] to bring his assistant to your home for diagnosis and treatment and medicine. He left for Shanghai before you even had time to say thank you for saving your life. Later, [Zhang Junshi]'s parents passed away. To repay your kindness, you went to visit the grave on time.
One day ten years ago (1904), you went to the "Lujia Tavern" with your freshly caught game as usual - the pub was closed at that time, and only an [old man] with a foreign accent was drinking. After you entered the store and delivered the game, the boss 【Lü Songnian】Go to the counter and get you money. A regular customer of the tavern and a wealthy man in the town [Xue Dacai] (you often see him in the tavern, so you know this) opened the door with his cousin [Zhu Lingshan].
[The old man] was already red in the face from drinking. When he saw [Xue Dacai] and the others, he staggered over. [Zhu Lingshan] stepped forward to help the [old man], but the [old man] suddenly fell down, clutching his heart. You and [Lü Songnian] rushed over and saw that [the old man] was out of breath due to excessive drinking, his face was almost cyanotic from holding back, and he was talking intermittently... Only then did you see clearly [Old Man] is none other than your father's master and the former member of the "Taiping Army" who was known as "Yida Taiping" decades ago [Yan Yichong] - You were distracted for a moment and did not hear clearly what [Yan Yichong] said, you only heard [Zhu Lingshan] asked: "What (what) is "Mrs. Wisteria"?"
You didn't dare to recognize [Yan Yichong] and watched him die in front of you without breathing. Fortunately, except for you, the other three people didn't know him, let alone suspect your origins.
The second shopkeeper of the tavern [Lü Lusheng] ran out of the kitchen at the back. Seeing that there were lives in the shop, he was so anxious that he was sweating profusely. He grabbed you guys and begged you not to report him to the official, and asked his eldest brother [Lü Songnian] Go to the cabinet and take out the money for everyone. [Xue Dacai] took the lead in agreeing to keep it secret for the sake of money, and you and the others did not object (you and your younger brother were hiding in the town, and you were more afraid of the officialdom than anyone else), [Xue Dacai] took everyone and made it known A poisonous oath: If anyone still remembers this in his heart, he will die badly!
Then you opened [Yan Yichong]'s luggage and saw that in addition to clothes and money, there was also a "cowhide map" with the location of "Baoshu Town" and an "old military sword" with the word "Taiping" engraved on the scabbard. Words - At the request of [Lü Lusheng], you took [Yan Yichong]’s body and these things under the night to bury them under “Yutou Mountain” near the “cemetery”, and then you returned with the money you received. Home·····
This year (1914), on June 7, you found the body of [Ge Jixian] in the "Wild Deer Forest" - he was hung from a tree, his right ear was cut off, his teeth were all missing, and his hands and feet were broken. ·····When you went to report the news, you guessed that it was an enemy seeking revenge, otherwise you wouldn't be so cruel.
Soon after, [Zhang Junshi] took [Mrs. Zhang] back to town, and you took your little brother to the "Zhang Family" to express your gratitude.
On August 30th, [Yu Yancheng] brought a handwritten letter from [Mrs. Zhang], asking you to pick up [Mrs. Zhang]’s niece [Zhi Jun] when you go to Guangzhou to sell animal skins. When the time comes, [Mrs. Zhang] 】I will drive to the ferry to pick you up. You then went to Guangzhou with the Orions and stayed behind to pick up people.
On September 2nd, you saw a girl with long hair tied back at the station. The person accompanying her was none other than [Zhang Junshi]. They came over together when they saw you. You took out the autographed letter from [Mrs. Zhang] , confirmed that the girl in front of you is the [Zhi Jun] you want to pick up.
After [Zhang Junshi] introduced you to [Zhi Jun], he said that he had to go to Shanghai in an emergency, so he gave [Zhi Jun] to you and sent him back to "Baoshu Town". You then took [Zhi Jun] on the train to "Sanshuihekou Station", not talking much along the way, and stayed at "Sanshuihekou Town" in the evening. You rented two rooms and rested separately from [Zhi Jun].
On September 3rd, early in the morning, you took [Zhi Jun] by boat to cross the "Xijiang River". You didn't meet anyone who came to pick him up, so you walked back to "Baoshu Town" together.
In the morning, you sent [Zhi Jun] to the "Zhang Family", and [Mrs. Zhang] took her to put her luggage, leaving only you and [Le Wan] - you had a good impression of [Le Wan] for a long time, but she suddenly You left without saying goodbye (you were so disappointed at that time that you even went to the pub to get drunk), but now you saw each other again, but you didn't know what to say, and you were thinking about your little brother at home, so you left in a hurry.
After you returned to "Yu's House", you listened to [Yu Yancheng] talk about what happened in the town these days (so you knew everything about Yu Yancheng), and then the younger brother said that he had made money these days and wanted to invite him. Brother, you have a drink. After saying that, the boy ran out to buy a drink. [Yu Yancheng] After returning from buying wine, he mentioned that the two "Lu Family" brothers were leaving town. The "Lu Family Tavern" was looking for a buyer, and the price was set at a low price, but they needed cash. You think this is a good opportunity and ask your younger brother to take out the money at home and do some calculations.
In the afternoon, you want to ask for details (the price I said is too cheap, I don’t know if I heard it wrong), so you leave [Yu Yancheng] at home and go out alone. You come to the outside of "Lujia Tavern" and see the advertisement "Emergency Shop for Sale" posted outside, but there is no one inside. You asked around and someone saw [Lü Lusheng] going to "Yutou Mountain".
You rushed to the west of the town and just arrived at the "cemetery". After the funeral, you saw [Mrs. Zhang], [Le Wan] and others wearing black veils. At this time, you saw [Lü Lusheng], who was being carried by a man. The young man (Xue Yufan) holding a "quick rifle" tightly grasped...

Act 4:
On September 3rd, you left the "cemetery" and rushed home. When you saw that your little brother [Yu Yancheng] was safe and sound, you grew up.
Take a breath.
In the evening, [Yu Yancheng] told you again that he wanted you to buy the tavern - from now on he would be in charge of hunting, and you would be the "keeper" in the tavern. You said that you must be able to cook to open a tavern. You brothers can easily fight birds and beasts, but you don’t know how to make oil, salt, sauce and vinegar... [Yu Yancheng] confidently said that he had already Think about it - you can marry [Le Wan] as your sister-in-law, her cooking is delicious...
Only then did you realize that your little brother is no longer a child (you have really not cared about your own affairs for him these years) - This boy is right, [Le Wan] is an out-and-out good woman who can marry When she realizes that she is a man's blessing - you have made up your mind to find an opportunity to talk to her about what's on your mind. After all, you are both old, so why not live together, you will definitely be good to her.
Today (September 4) is the Ghost Festival (the fifteenth day of the seventh lunar month). According to custom, the "Ollan Festival" is held under the "Baoshu Pagoda". However, in the past few months, people have been missing and killed. The town has People are panicked - but you brothers are in a good mood. [Yu Yancheng] said that he plans to ask [Mrs. Zhang] to help facilitate your marriage. You said on your lips that he should stop messing around, but in your heart you hope that [Mrs. Zhang] will come forward to act as a matchmaker - you suddenly I remembered that when I picked up [Zhi Jun] in Guangzhou, [Zhang Junshi] asked her to tell [Mrs. Zhang] that when he comes back from Shanghai, he must add a lovely child to the "Zhang family".
In the morning, [Yu Yancheng] changed into new clothes and went out to the "Zhang Family". You stayed at home to wait for the news, but you felt a little restless, so you went to burn incense in front of the "ancestral tablets". After that, you took out the "gun" that you haven't used in the past few days and cleaned it, wiping the "flying wing pattern" on it while waiting for your little brother to come back.
At noon, someone knocks on the door. You put down your things and go to open the door. When you see it is [Le Wan], you quickly straighten your clothes. [Le Wan] outside the courtyard gate turned red and whispered that she left something at your house... You remember that shortly after she moved out, you sent all the luggage to the "Zhang Family" - but You still let [Le Wan] come in and together we went to the wing where she lived before.
You asked [Le Wan] why she left so suddenly, and she lowered her head and said that [Lü Lusheng] often came here to harass her when you were out hunting, and she didn’t dare to stay any longer. You heard that your heart was filled with anger. If it weren’t for knowing that “Lü Lusheng” "Home" something serious happened to someone's life yesterday, you must go out to find [Lü Lusheng] to settle the score.
When you walked into the wing, [Le Wan] lay down on the bed in the room, blushing and whispered: "Brother Yu, my things are right here..." Your heartbeat suddenly accelerated, and you said sheepishly When you turn your head, you catch a glimpse of someone peering outside the window, and you yell: "Who is that person?" The person outside hears the sound and runs away. You chase him out and see that person has already run out of the yard - don't dare to be careless, copy He picked up a wooden stick in the yard (usually used for hunting and is very strong) and chased him out.
The man ran into "Lü's Tavern" in one breath. Looking at the back, he seemed to be [Lü Lusheng] - You have been in the town for so many years. In order to avoid danger, you have already investigated the surrounding environment clearly and know that there is a person behind "Lü's Tavern". The dug hole is usually covered up, allowing access to the backyard of the tavern - you want to settle a score with "the man surnamed Lu", but you are worried about being ambushed after chasing you through the front door, so you run to the back of the tavern and get in through the hole.
You walked into the tavern from the backyard and saw [Lü Lusheng] panting in front of the counter, seeming to be packing something. You couldn't help but pick up the wooden stick and hit him on the head from behind. [Lü Lusheng] fell to the ground. Hell, you put a wine jar on his head and warned him not to harass [Le Wan] again!
Then you saw that this guy was motionless and the stick was stained with blood, so you quickly put your ear to [Lü Lusheng]’s heart and heard that there was still a heartbeat.
At this time, there is a knock on the door outside the tavern. If you are afraid that someone will come in and see you, you will think you are a gangster, so you throw away the wooden stick and drag [Lü Lusheng] to the groove behind the counter. The drinkers outside the door cannot see the shopkeeper, so it is very difficult. He'll be gone soon, so you can wait until he wakes up and teach him a lesson - then you sneak back to the backyard of the tavern and hide.
Soon, you heard someone coming to the backyard, so you leaned out and saw your younger brother [Yu Yancheng] walking into the kitchen in the backyard with the cleanly cut and fresh meat of the game. Then there was a sound in the kitchen. You walked in from outside the door. Look, you see [Xue Yufan] holding a "quick rifle" and pointing the muzzle at [Yu Yancheng]. You rush in immediately and knock down [Xue Yufan]. The kid immediately faints.
[Yu Yancheng] said that he had no grudges with [Xue Yufan], which was probably a misunderstanding - he came to the kitchen to cook for [Mrs. Zhang], and then asked [Mrs. Zhang] to be a matchmaker - [Yu Yancheng] 】 He also asked you to follow his arrangements, come into the tavern after a while, and say to his face that you want to marry 【Le Wan】.
You were relieved. In order to prevent [Xue Yufan] from doing anything to your little brother, you dragged him out of the hole in the wall with a gun, put him on your shoulders, and walked to the mountain southeast of the "Lu Family Tavern" to find him. Drop the person somewhere with lush weeds, throw his gun away, and then return to the "Lu Family Tavern" - You saw [Mrs. Zhang]'s car parked outside the tavern, and thought about asking her to be a matchmaker, so you thought about it for a while. How to speak before pushing open the pub door.
As soon as you walked into the tavern, you saw [Le Wan] coming out of the kitchen. She had an apron on her waist and was holding dishes in her hands. She looked just like she did when she lived in your house. You couldn't help but think of what she said when she was lying on her side on the bed just now. He couldn't help but close the door behind him, walked over quickly, grabbed her hand, and wanted to tell her what was in his heart.
[Le Wan]'s face suddenly turned red. She put the dishes on the counter, but you still didn't let go. [Le Wan] looked aside, and then you noticed that [Mrs. Zhang] was also in the tavern. , she was lying on the table by the window, you only noticed【Le Wan】when you came in...
The door of the tavern was pushed open, and [Ge Yueman] walked in with a girl (Zhi Jun) with long hair tied behind her head. She went to help [Mrs. Zhang] up, but she suddenly screamed and fell to the ground· ·····With the sound of things breaking, [Lü Lusheng] crawled out from behind the counter, his head still bleeding... [Xue Yufan] also ran in from the door, he looked panicked, There is grass on the body...
