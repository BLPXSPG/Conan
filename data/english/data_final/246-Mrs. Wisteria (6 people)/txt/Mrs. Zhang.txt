background story
September 4, the third year of the Republic of China (1914 AD) (the fifteenth day of the seventh lunar month)
After Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty abdicated, the "Beiyang Government" established its capital in Beijing, and Yuan Shikai became president. The Western powers are busy on the European battlefield and have no time to look eastward. China seems to be ushering in a new situation.
In Guangdong Province in the south, there is the "Guangsan Railway", which was completed and opened to traffic in 1903. It connects Guangzhou and Foshan to the "Sanshuihekou Station". Get off the train here, then cross the "Xijiang" to the west, and then enter a Luxurious Mountains - One of them is "Baoshu Town" hidden in the mountains and forests. The entrance of the town is nearly 2 hours' walk from the ferry of "Xijiang". There is only one road leading in and out of the town. The population of the town is concentrated in the center of the town. Among them, the "Ge family" has the largest business - the head of the family, Ge Jixian, has served as the town's mayor. "Bao Chang" gave birth to two daughters. The eldest daughter, Ge Yueman, married away from Tianjin. The younger daughter, Ge Yueluo, was left behind and hired Zhu Lingshan, a foreigner, as his son-in-law.
Three months ago, Ge Jixian was kidnapped by bandits, and only a corpse with its right ear cut off, all teeth missing, and hands and feet broken was found. It was so horrific... Ge Yueluo was distraught and angered the whole world. House slaves, drive these people out of the "Ge family".
At that time, no one could have thought that this was just the beginning of the tragedy in "Baoshu Town" - it all started on September 1, three days ago. ． ． ． ． ．

The "Zhang Family" is a family that has lived in "Baoshu Town" for generations. The family house is located to the east of the "Baoshu Tower", with the main road outside the door. It is a building with a single door and a single courtyard.


Act 1:
your story
(Please do not read the script directly during the game. When acting, you must conform to the character's personality. You can add content that is not written in the script on the basis that it does not violate the character setting)
Your name is [Zhu Li], your English nickname is "Julie", and you were born in 1885. Your maiden name is "Feng" and your ancestral home is Shandong. Your husband [Zhang Junshi] is from "Baoshu Town". Two months ago (July), he took you back to his hometown as you wished.
You and your husband are in free love - this was a very big deal in the Qing Dynasty more than ten years ago - after you met [Zhang Junshi], who is five years older than you, you quickly fell in love. Zhang Junshi] was working as a doctor in Shanghai, and you went there to find him despite your family's objections. This behavior was opposed by both parents. [Zhang Junshi] resolutely quit his job in the hospital and took you to elope to Zezhou Prefecture, Shanxi Province ( You have a cousin in the local area who has opened a private clinic. Through your cousin's introduction, he treats some wealthy families and earns a lot of money.
You worked as an assistant to [Zhang Junshi] for three years, and finally waited for his proposal. In 1904, you and [Zhang Junshi] officially got married and became legitimately [Mrs. Zhang]. The only regret you and your husband have is that they have never been together. child.
Time flies by. [Zhang Junshi]’s parents passed away one after another, leaving him property in his hometown town. Because he was disobedient to his parents, he never came back to take care of him. Until not long ago, you proposed that you want to go back to his hometown to have a look. I hope The couple can spend some private time in "Baoshu Town" and relive the charm of the past.
[Zhang Junshi] After taking you back to "Baoshu Town", first go to pay homage to the ancestral graves of the "Zhang Family" - I feel relieved to see that it is not abandoned. Then he hired people to clean up the old "Zhang Family" house near the "Baoshu Pagoda" in the west of the town, and hired new servants - the men seemed to pay special attention to "returning home in rich clothes", [Zhang Junshi] used the excuse that the roads in the town were not good Let's go, I bought a new "Ford Model T" specially for you, so that after you learn to drive, you can use the car to travel, and it will suddenly cause a sensation in the town. Unfortunately, this car can only be driven on the road. Breakdowns can happen off the road.
[Zhang Junshi] I haven’t lived in the “Zhang Family” for long, but I have to be separated from you temporarily because it’s hard to take time off from work in a private clinic. Some patients have to take special medicine every once in a while. The most important ingredient in the medicine is, You have to go to Shanghai to buy it, so [Zhang Junshi] can only leave you in your hometown, go to Shanghai first, and then return to Shanxi to deliver the medicine.
Last month (August), you received some items and a lot of car fuel from your husband, but the fuel barrels were unloaded on the ground outside your house by the "freight man". When you were worried, you saw a local teenager. Orion [Yu Yancheng], he helped you move everything into the warehouse. You were very grateful to this enthusiastic young man. You let him have afternoon tea, and made reservations for daily game with him. After that, [Yu Yancheng] often brought the prey he caught. Tie it to his "gun" and deliver it to your house. After you pay, you will let him in for some snacks.
Also sent with the fuel was a letter from a cousin in Shanxi. It turns out that your cousin plans to send his daughter [Zhi Jun] (your niece) to study medicine in Guangzhou, but the school will not start until October. He heard that you It’s not far from Guangzhou. I hope you can let [Zhi Jun] stay at your house for a few days. When you and your husband came to Shanxi to make a living, thanks to the help of this cousin, you also watched [Zhi Jun] grow up. Just like his own child, he immediately telegraphed his promise.
The "Zhang Family" had a good relationship with the "Ge Family" in the town. When you came to visit, you learned that something unfortunate had happened to the "Ge Family" recently - the owner [Ge Jixian] was kidnapped and killed by bandits, leaving behind a daughter [Yue Luo] 】Inherit the inheritance.
[Yueluo] She is close to you in age and soon became friends. You found that she was in poor health and was easily frightened. She always hung curtains in the house and lit candles before it got dark. After you returned home, from your husband Among the medicines brought, I found a "special medicine" for [Yueluo]. After taking it, her pain was relieved and her mood began to improve.
On the morning of August 30, you received a "telegram" from your niece, saying that she was arriving in Guangzhou soon. Your husband is not in the town and you are worrying about how to pick her up. [Yu Yancheng] sent you today's freshly caught game. He heard about this and asked his brother [Yu Shangyong] to go to Guangzhou to help you pick up your niece. - You I immediately wrote a letter to my niece and handed it to [Yu Yancheng] outside the door, saying that when they cross the "Xijiang River", you will drive to the ferry to pick them up.
At noon, [Yue Luo] asked her husband [Zhu Lingshan] to drive her to the "Zhang Family" in a carriage to find you, but there was an argument outside the door. Your newly hired female assistant [Le Wan] came into the house and told you that you Let her stay in the house to prepare tea, and then go out to pick up [Yue Luo] - You saw [Yue Luo] was so angry that her husband was shaking all over. In order to relax with her, he drove her from east to west in the town. A circle of wind.
In the afternoon, you drove your car home and saw the "Ge's" carriage still parked outside your house, but you didn't see [Zhu Lingshan] - because the road from "Zhang's" to "Ge's" was not suitable for driving, so you Send [Yueluo] home on foot, and then walk back alone (then the carriage will no longer be at your door).
On September 1st, in the morning, you went to "Ge's House" to see [Yueluo]. Before you started chatting, several uninvited guests came outside, including [Le Wan]. There is also [Yu Yancheng] who is sweating profusely...


Act 2:
You actually lied to others... In fact, you not only knew [Xue Yufan], but also met him on the 30th - this young man always came to your house on the pretext that he likes cars. You can feel him What it means to you - [Xue Yufan] You know that you are married, but you insist on pestering her. Plus your husband is not at home at the moment, you are afraid of being gossiped about.
On the afternoon of August 30th, after you delivered [Yueluo], you met [Xue Yufan] when you came home. He had just drunk, he was emotional, and he was arrogant. You were worried that rejecting him at this time would cause a disturbance. (Young people are easy to be impulsive, and you are afraid that they will make trouble regardless of everything). When you saw the carriage of the "Ge family" parked outside the door (you did not see Zhu Lingshan), you had an idea and asked [Xue Yufan] to drive you to the west in the carriage. The "Mountain Pavilion" is the land of the "Ge Family". There are no residents around. You can explain it clearly to him, and you don't have to worry about him getting emotional. You will be in the carriage along the way to avoid being seen and misunderstood.
[Xue Yufan] When you go to drive, you hide in the carriage (the carriage door is at the back). You see that the seat is cushioned with "animal skins" (it has white spots on it), and you sit on it. The carriage ran for a while and then stopped. You asked several times, but there was no response from the outside. You opened the curtain on the side of the carriage and saw the "Mountain Pavilion"... You stepped out of the carriage, and there was no one nearby, [ Xue Yufan] didn't know where he went - you couldn't drive a carriage, so you had to walk all the way back to "Zhang's house".
On September 1st, in the evening, you took [Le Wan] to stay at the "Ge Family". [Yue Luo] kept saying that she was in pain, and then burst into tears. The servants of the "Ge Family" stayed away from each other. You and [Le Wan] stayed away from each other. [Le Wan] comforted her and sent her up to the second floor and back to her room. [Yue Luo] was a little confused and kept shouting: "I hurt, my body hurts... My father was killed..." Then she grabbed you and asked you to get it. "Special medicine", you have no choice, leave [Le Wan] to take care of you, rush home, use the key to open the door of the medicine room (after your husband left, you were the only one who carried the only medicine room key with you), find out A "red bottle" containing "special medicine" (labelled "Pain-killer") - This is a very effective "painkiller". When you were working as an assistant to your husband, you saw him prescribing it to patients, so you recommended it to [month Radish], the taboo is not to eat too much, as overdose may cause death.
You lock the door, take the medicine back to "Ge's house", watch [Le Wan] hold down [Yue Luo], and immediately ask her to let go. When [Le Wan] is about to explain, you tell her to shut up and leave here. . After [Le Wan] went out, [Yue Luo] shouted: "Give me the medicine quickly!" As soon as you took out the "red bottle", [Yue Luo] snatched it away, and you immediately held her hand. Shout: "You can only take one mouthful of this medicine. If you take too much, you will die!" [Yue Luo] did not let go. She looked up at you, like a wounded animal, and begged in a trembling voice: "Please go to the kitchen and get me a glass of boiling water..."
You can only agree, walk out of the room and see [Le Wan] standing outside the door. She explained that [Yue Luo] looked very scary just now, shouting that she wanted to commit suicide, so she went over and held down [Yue Luo]... You comforted [Le Wan] and asked her not to go in and disturb [Yue Luo], and then went downstairs to get water.
You go to the kitchen outside the mansion to get hot water. [Le Wan] comes over and says that [Yueluo] wants her to come to you. You wait for the water to cool down a little, then you and [Le Wan] get the water back upstairs and push When you enter the house, you see [Yueluo] curled up on the bed motionless, with a twisted and painful face. There is a broken "red medicine bottle" on the ground, which is empty. You walk over and find that [Yueluo] is gone. breathe······
Everything happened so suddenly. You recalled that [Yue Luo] mentioned the word "death" more than once before, but you didn't care... [Le Wan] took out a letter and said it was [Yue Luo] who asked her to die. She gave it to you. Your mind was in confusion at this time. You quickly opened the letter and read it with [Le Wan]. The main idea of ​​the letter was: If I die, I will ask Mrs. Zhang to take care of all my funeral affairs. I just Trusting her, my sister came back on September 2 and asked Mrs. Zhang to pick her up from the ferry when she picked up her niece.
After you read the letter, take [Le Wan] downstairs, gather the servants, tell them what happened, and then go home and drive to buy the coffin. When it got dark, you went to the "Li Ji Shou Wood Shop" in the east of the town. Seeing that the coffin was rough, you put the mattress and other items in it yourself, and then asked someone to carry it to "Ge's house". The servants of the "Ge family" avoid touching the body, so you and [Le Wan] can only carry the body into the coffin, put it in the room for mourning, and then arrange for someone to decorate the hall into a mourning hall and light candles. You and [Le Wan] stayed at the "Ge family" this night and did not go home.
On the morning of September 2nd, [Zhu Lingshan] is still missing, so you hire someone to carry the coffin to the "Ge family". In front of the family tomb in the "cemetery", set up a funeral shed and place the coffin inside to rest (according to custom At least relatives must come to identify the body before it can be buried in a coffin.) He led his servants in a farewell ceremony.
You see, these servants have no feelings for the "Ge family". Knowing that they are all newcomers and often insulted by [Yue Luo],
Don't think it's strange either.
At noon, the crowd dispersed, and you saw that [Le Wan] was still crying. Thinking that she had been busy all night, he took her back to the "Zhang Family" to rest.
Then you cheered up, drove out of "Baoshu Town", and went to the ferry to pick up people - you waited at the ferry until the afternoon, and finally saw [Ge Yueman] getting off the boat, and recognized her at a glance - [Ge Yueman] had short hair , wearing a Western-style dress that was not available in the town, holding a "suitcase" and a sunhat, similar in appearance to [Yue Luo], but with a completely different temperament.
You give [Yue Luo]'s letter to [Ge Yueman] and tell her that [Yue Luo] has committed suicide... [Ge Yueman] can't believe it and asks you to take her to the town to see the body immediately, but you I still had to pick up my niece and [Yu Shangyong], so I waited at the ferry until dusk. Seeing the river turned red, the last ferry had stopped working, and there was still no one to pick up.
During this period, you and [Ge Yueman] didn’t talk much, and she still couldn’t accept the news of [Yueluo]’s death... You saw that it was getting late, and you guessed that the train was delayed, so you drove [Ge Yueman] back to "Bao" "Shu Town" - [Ge Yueman] insists on going to the "cemetery" first, so you have no choice but to agree.
When it got dark, you two women came to the "cemetery" and saw [Ge Jixian]'s tombstone and the coffin in the funeral shed in the "Ge family" family cemetery. [Ge Yueman] burst into tears, and you couldn't bear it. She kept crying... After a long time, [Ge Yueman] stopped crying. Together, you said goodbye to [Yueluo]'s body in the coffin, closed the coffin lid, and returned to the car.
After that, you drove the car back to "Zhang's house" and were about to take [Ge Yueman] back to "Ge's house" on foot. When you met [Le Wan], she said she was waiting for you here, and then [Le Wan] wanted to come over and help [Ge Yueman] took the "suitcase", but was rejected - you can see that [Ge Yueman] is eager to return home at this time, so he and [Le Wan] send her back to the "Ge family".
[Ge Yueman] went upstairs to put his luggage, and you and [Le Wan] stayed in the hall that was decorated as a mourning hall. Everything was lifeless... Soon, you saw [Yu Yancheng] supporting [Xue Yufan], and there were people behind him. Following a man (Lü Lusheng) who looked similar to [Lü Songnian], they walked into the "Ge Family" together, and [Ge Yueman] also walked down from the second floor.

Act 3:
On September 2nd, in the evening, [Le Wan] and you returned to "Zhang's House" and fell asleep quickly - you had many things to say to your husband.
My husband told me, but I don’t know when he will come back.
You see [Xue Yufan] suffered so much, was so hungry that he didn't even have the strength to walk, and was sent back to the "Xue family". It is estimated that he will not harass you again for the time being, so he finally feels relieved - you only worry about other things now Will people believe what you say - You don't want your husband to hear any rumors about you after he comes back.
As for [Lü Lusheng], he gives you a very bad feeling - this man seems to know a lot of things, but doesn't reveal anything. You feel that the way he looks at others is not friendly.
On the morning of September 3rd, you saw [Yu Shangyong] who looked similar to [Yu Yancheng] - he sent your niece [Zhi Jun] to the "Zhang family" safely.
You took [Zhi Jun] to put her luggage, asked her about the situation at home, and then talked about some past events - when you and your husband first arrived in Shanxi, you didn't have much money on hand, so you took out all the things you brought from home and sold them. , exchange money for turnover. Some of the artworks, such as oil paintings, etc., were sold at good prices only because [Zhi Jun]’s father (that is, your cousin in Shanxi) introduced a local wealthy businessman. With this money, 【Zhang Junshi】’s clinic was successfully opened.
You and your husband are very grateful to this cousin. At that time, [Zhi Jun] was still young and her mother had passed away. Sometimes you would help your cousin take care of her. When [Zhi Jun] got older, she often came to the clinic to talk to you. You and your husband learned Cantonese, and you also fell in love with medicine - you once introduced your favorite manuscript story to [Zhi Jun], which was a play written by the Englishman [Zhaospier] and translated into "Luo Gongzi" "With Miss Zhu" tells the poignant story of a young man and woman who fell in love but were opposed by their families but remained faithful. In the end, "Mr. Luo" took poison and "Miss Zhu" committed suicide with her lover's sword, and both died in love... ···Maybe because [Zhi Jun] is too young, she is not very interested in this kind of "Butterfly Lovers"-style love story. Instead, she cannot put down the medical books of [Zhang Junshi].
[Zhi Jun] has mastered a lot of medical knowledge through self-study, and knows medicine better than you who have worked as a clinic assistant. [Zhang Junshi] therefore values ​​her very much and wants to introduce her to study medicine in the south - you and your husband have both heard of it. As early as more than ten years ago, an American medical missionary "Dr. Fumali" founded China's first women's medical school - "Guangdong Women's Medical College" in Guangzhou; On March 8, 1907, the former Qing court promulgated the charter of the Women's Normal School, further affirming the legal status of women's schools.
[Zhang Junshi] I often tell others about the prosperity and novelty of Guangzhou or Shanghai, and I always encourage girls to go out of the house. These two things are very disliked by your cousin. You can understand that your cousin must be reluctant to let go of his only daughter who is only 17 years old. You went to such a far place alone (your cousin has a job and cannot leave Shanxi), but [Zhi Jun] showed extraordinary talent in medicine, and your husband interceded for this matter more than once - finally this year ( In August 1914), your usually stubborn cousin finally agreed to let [Zhi Jun] go to the south to study medicine. Your husband was very happy. After returning to Shanxi to deliver medicine, he took his niece south to Guangzhou.
You heard [Zhi Jun] say that your husband sent her to Guangzhou, and met [Yu Shangyong] at the train station to pick her up. They were supposed to come back together, but because [Zhang Junshi]'s old friend in Shanghai was in an emergency, he If you have no choice but to go to Shanghai again, you can only ask [Zhi Jun] to send you a message, and he will come back to reunite with you after he finishes his work.
When you hear this, you can't help but feel a little regret - if you hadn't asked "brothers from the Yu family" to pick you up, your husband would definitely come back - even if he only has time to stay for one night, he can still let you enjoy the tenderness and say something from your heart.
You settled your niece, collected your thoughts, and came out to thank [Yu Shangyong], only to find that he had already left - you agreed yesterday to attend [Ge Yueluo]'s funeral today, so you left your niece who had come all the way to rest in the "Zhang Family" ( You feel it is inconvenient to take her to such an occasion), and then take [Le Wan] to the "Ge Family".
You went upstairs and had a brief chat with [Ge Yueman] for a while. Because the redness and swelling in the eyes have not gone away, you all put on black veils, then led the others to the "cemetery" and started to hold a burial ceremony for [Ge Yueluo] .
[Ge Yueman] She still cried loudly in front of the cemetery. You kept persuading her and watched the hired people carry the coffin from the funeral shed to the "Ge family" family cemetery (located south of the entrance to the cemetery) for burial... ·
You watched people begin to burn paper dummies and gold and silver paper according to custom... Amid the wailing, a new building
Tombs were piled up.
In the afternoon, after the funeral, on your way back, you saw [Xue Yufan] holding a "rifle", grabbing [Lü Lusheng], and arguing... [Yu Shangyong] came from a distance .

Act 4:
You are now playing the niece of [Mrs. Zhang] [Zhi Jun] - you and your aunt have the same surname. The name [Zhi Jun] is the nickname given to you when you were young by your uncle. He explained it this way: Zhi Jun (yún) means young man. "Bamboo" also.
The previous content was all told by your aunt [Mrs. Zhang] herself, and it happened a few days ago.
your story
You were born in 1898. Your mother died shortly after you were born, and you were raised by your father alone. You once heard your father say when he was drunk that he could do anything but not let his daughter get hurt... It made you feel The father is great - he has been protecting his daughter since her mother passed away.
As [Mrs. Zhang] knows, your father once objected to your going to Guangzhou, but your uncle often said that you were very talented and that girls would become doctors in the future. Your father didn't like this kind of "bewitching" that your uncle always said. "The girl went out to school, but he also felt that a new era was coming.
You actually really want to go to Guangzhou - this is definitely not influenced by any new trend of thought. You can't even stand girls cutting their hair short (you have seen a girl having her hair cut short, and you have stayed away from them since then, lest you be tied behind your head) Targeted for long hair) - You are really interested in studying medicine, but you just can’t bear to be away from your father.
In the end it was your father who made the decision - your aunt and uncle hurried to the south in July and didn't even come to say goodbye to you, which made you sad for a long time - you didn't expect that last month (August), your father and uncle returned to Shanxi to deliver medicine. After meeting with your uncle, he finally agreed to let you go to school in Guangzhou, and entrusted your uncle to take care of you all the way, so that you can concentrate on your studies there and don't have to worry about things at home. He will naturally take care of everything, so you don't have to worry.
On August 19, with uneasiness and longing, you left the place where you grew up and followed your uncle all the way south. When you were approaching Guangzhou, your uncle asked you to send a telegram to your aunt, saying that you would arrive in a few days.
On September 2nd, you finally arrived in Guangzhou and met [Yu Shangyong] who came to pick you up at the station. He showed you and your uncle a letter written by your aunt. Your uncle also knew him, so he handed you over to this person. Then your uncle said His old friend in Shanghai is in a hurry and has to rush there. Since someone has come to pick you up, he will leave immediately - your uncle asked you to tell your aunt that when he comes back, you must add a lovely child to the "Zhang family" (listen I blushed when I finished and didn’t tell my aunt).
After that, [Yu Shangyong] will take you on the train to "Sanshuihekou Station" and stay at "Sanshuihekou Town" in the evening. You rented two rooms and rested separately - you found that [Yu Shangyong] didn't like to talk and seemed to have a lot of stories in his heart. He only talked more when he mentioned his younger brother [Yu Yancheng].
In the morning of September 3rd, [Yu Shangyong] will take you by boat to cross the "Xijiang River" and walk back to "Baoshu Town" to meet your aunt. Afterwards, you were left at the "Zhang Family" to settle your luggage, and your aunt took [Le Wan] out to attend the funeral of [Ge Yueluo]. After that, [Le Wan] came back first, and your aunt went to the "Ge Family".
In the evening, my aunt came back from the "Ge Family". She seemed very tired, but she still cheered up and introduced you to the situation of "Baoshu Town" and talked about everything that happened in the town a few days ago (so you knew that Mrs. Zhang had previously all things). Before going to bed, my aunt went to the medicine room as usual to check that there was no shortage of medicine, then locked the door and took the key with her. Then my aunt told [Le Wan] that when my uncle comes back, he will take you to Guangzhou together, and he may not come back again.
Today (September 4) is the Ghost Festival (the fifteenth day of the seventh lunar month). According to custom, the "Ollan Festival" is held under the "Baoshu Pagoda". However, in the past few months, people have been missing and killed. The town has People are panicking.
In the morning, [Yu Shangyong]’s brother [Yu Yancheng] came to see [Mrs. Zhang] and said he wanted to treat her and [Le Wan] to dinner. He also mentioned that his brother was going to be the shopkeeper of the tavern-their brothers planned to take over.” Lu’s Tavern”.
[Mrs. Zhang] and [Le Wan] both liked this young man and agreed to the invitation - You slept very late yesterday and were left at the "Zhang family" (they thought you didn't get up, but you saw everything from the window). Not long after the aunt and others left, a woman (Ge Yueman) came to the "Zhang family" to find [Mrs. Zhang]. You told her that [Mrs. Zhang] drove [Le Wan] and [Yu Yancheng] out, probably to have a drink. Play... [Ge Yueman] Saying goodbye outside the "Zhang Family" door, you watched her walk in the direction of the "Ge Family".
At noon, you remember that your uncle said that there is a kind of "Lobelia" growing by the water of "Lotus Stream" that can be used to make medicine. You want to look for it, so you walk to the east of the town alone.
Before you take the turn off to "Lotus Creek", you see your aunt's car parked outside a tavern (Lu's Tavern). You guess that she and [Le Wan] are drinking there. You want to go in and say hello, so you go there. Doorway (the door to the tavern is closed).
At this time [Ge Yueman] also came over, she pushed open the door of the tavern, and you saw [Yu Shangyong] in the tavern holding both hands of [Le Wan], her aunt was lying on the table by the window, [Ge Yueman] went to help her She suddenly screamed and fell to the ground... With the sound of things breaking, a man (Lü Lusheng) crawled out from behind the counter, with blood still bleeding from his head... A panicked young man (Xue Yufan) ran in from the door with grass on his body... (You are not Mrs. Zhang. There is no way to know the whole experience of the deceased. You can only rely on everything you know. to determine the truth)
