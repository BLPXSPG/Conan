In Guangdong Province in the south, there is the "Guangsan Railway", which was completed and opened to traffic in 1903. It connects Guangzhou and Foshan to the "Sanshuihekou Station". Get off the train here, then cross the "Xijiang" to the west, and then enter a Luxurious Mountains - One of them is "Baoshu Town" hidden in the mountains and forests. The entrance of the town is nearly 2 hours' walk from the ferry of "Xijiang". There is only one road leading in and out of the town. The population of the town is concentrated in the center of the town. Among them, the "Ge family" has the largest business - the head of the family, Ge Jixian, has served as the town's mayor. "Bao Chang" gave birth to two daughters. The eldest daughter, Ge Yueman, married away from Tianjin. The younger daughter, Ge Yueluo, was left behind and hired Zhu Lingshan, a foreigner, as his son-in-law.
Three months ago, Ge Jixian was kidnapped by bandits, and only a corpse with its right ear cut off, all teeth missing, and hands and feet broken was found. It was so horrific... Ge Yueluo was distraught and angered the whole world. House slaves, drive these people out of the "Ge family"...
At that time, no one could have thought that this was just the beginning of the tragedy in "Baoshu Town" - it all started on September 1, three days ago. ． ． ． ． ．

The "Ge family" is the most wealthy family in "Baoshu Town". The family's house is located in the north of the "town center" and built against the mountain. It is a two-story house with stone steps in front of the door, with a Lingnan style.
The property of the "Ge family" includes many mountains, forests and land in the town, extending from the "Yelu Forest" to the "Mountain Pavilion" area. In the "cemetery", there is also a family cemetery that has been built.

You are [Ge Jixian]’s youngest daughter, named [Yue Luo], born in 1886. After your grandmother passed away, your sister [Yue Man] married away in Tianjin. My father was afraid that the "Ge family" would be cut off from now on. I'm sorry for the ancestors of the "Ge family". When you were 21 years old (1906), you recruited [Zhu Lingshan] I will be your husband - [Zhu Lingshan] is originally from Guangxi. He is two years older than you. He has no father or mother. He has been educated for a few years and is decent-looking. Plus [Zhu Lingshan]’s cousin [Xue Dacai] is with you. There is some friendship with your father, and once he was recommended, he fell into your father's eyes. Even so, in the "will" made by your father, you were still designated as the heir to all the property of the "Ge family".
Ever since you were little, the only thing you have never forgotten is your sister [Yue Man] who you grew up with... The day your sister left to get married, you felt as if you were abandoned by her. While crying, you left the house alone. All the clothes left by my sister were burned, and she still hasn’t gotten rid of loneliness and resentment. As the sister of the family, [Yueman] can marry her lover, but you have become a tool to continue the family lineage of the "Ge family". Husband [Zhu Lingshan] has never been He doesn't know how to talk about love. For you who long for true love, he is just a "servant" who sleeps with you. He is responsible for driving a box carriage to pick up your father when he goes out.
On June 2 this year (1914), in the evening, you went upstairs to look for your father in his room. The maid [Le Wan] brought in a piece of paper with scrawled writing on it, which said: "'Chao Tiger King" please Ge The master went up to the mountain to stay for a few days, and then he was sent back to his family, and he was not allowed to report it to the official! "With cold hands and feet, you called [Zhu Lingshan] sternly and asked him to go out and inquire. He learned that "Chaohu King" was the name of the bandit. He was too frightened to say anything and spent several days in fear.
On June 7, hunter [Yu Shangyong] saw your father's body in the "Wild Deer Forest" - he was hung on a tree, his right ear was cut off, all his teeth were missing, his hands and feet were broken... ···You rushed to the "Wild Deer Forest" and witnessed it with your own eyes, convulsed and fell, and it took a long time before you cried out... From that day on, you were constantly awakened by nightmares, with the broken corpse lingering in front of you. go.
You have already contracted the disease and are in great pain every day. A sudden sound can make your heart beat faster and your pores shrink. You have people hang up thick curtains in the room and light candles before it gets dark, but you still can't resist the sorrow and fear in your heart. When you need comfort most, [Zhu Lingshan] turns a blind eye and doesn't care about you at night. People also hid secretly, no matter how much you yelled, no one came... You also thought that when your father was kidnapped, no one in the house knew about it, and you became even more sad and angry - at the end of June, you don't care These "wastes" have been serving in the "Ge family" for many years. They are all driven away, regardless of age or gender, and rehired... During this period, only [Mrs. Zhang] who lives nearby often comes to visit you - The "Zhang family" originally lived in the town. [Mrs. Zhang]'s husband [Zhang Junshi] went out to work more than ten years ago. Until two months ago (July), he sent his wife back to his hometown. Leave in a hurry.
The "Zhang family" and the "Ge family" had a relationship before. [Mrs. Zhang] came to visit after returning to town. You were similar in age and quickly became friends - you took the "special medicine" brought by [Mrs. Zhang] ” (a very effective “analgesic”), relieved the pain, and the condition improved slightly.
At noon on August 30th, you asked [Zhu Lingshan] to drive you to the "Zhang Family" in a carriage. He looked unhappy. When he arrived at the door of the "Zhang Family", he would not send you in. You were shaking with anger. Thanks 【Mrs. Zhang】I’ll come out to pick you up.
You and [Mrs. Zhang] leave [Zhu Lingshan] behind and drive a car (Mrs. Zhang owns a "Ford Model T", which is her old
(given to her by her father-in-law) went for a spin around town.
In the afternoon, you and [Mrs. Zhang] drove back to the "Zhang Family" and saw your family's carriage still parked outside the "Zhang Family" door, but did not see [Zhu Lingshan]. Because the road to "Ge's house" is not suitable for driving a car, and you don't know how to drive a carriage, [Mrs. Zhang] will take you back to "Ge's house" on foot. You have to walk this way very hard, thinking that this is all [ Zhu Lingshan]'s fault.
After you returned home, you didn't see your husband coming back in the carriage until night, making you even more depressed. The next day (31st), the man still did not show up, and you felt that your condition had worsened again.
On the morning of September 1st, [Mrs. Zhang] came to "Ge's house" to see you. Before we started chatting, several uninvited guests came outside, including [Zhu Lingshan]'s cousin [Xue Dacai], and your The dismissed maid [Le Wan].


Act 2:
You are now playing [Ge Yueluo]'s sister [Ge Yueman] - although you look similar to [Ge Yueluo], your personality and experience are completely different: for example, [Ge Yueluo] is thoughtful and thoughtful, but you are bold in doing things; [Ge Yueluo] You are dependent on others, but you pursue independence; [Ge Yueluo] You have never left "Baoshu Town" since you were a child, but you have lived outside for more than ten years...
your story
Your name is [Yueman]. You were born in 1885. You are the eldest daughter of [Ge Jixian]. She got married and left "Baoshu Town" in 1901. Before you were born, the "Ge family" had a public life with Tianjin. You have made a marriage arrangement with the "Li family" - you are now accustomed to life in the outside world, and the only connection with "Baoshu Town" is through letters, asking your younger sister [Yue Luo] to learn about the situation at home.
Not long ago, you received a letter from your younger sister, telling you that your father had been kidnapped and brutally murdered. This news was like a bolt from the blue. You were about to drop everything and rush back to your hometown, but you were delayed by family matters, so it was difficult to convince your husband. Let you go south alone to "Baoshu Town" - because you left home in a hurry, you only brought a "suitcase" with your belongings.
On the afternoon of September 2nd, you took a boat across the "Xijiang River" and met [Mrs. Zhang] driving a "Ford Model T" at the ferry. She recognized you at a glance because you were dressed differently (you had short hair). , wearing a Western-style dress that is not available in the town, holding a "suitcase" and wearing a sun hat), you have learned a lot about the little sister's letter and the friendship between her and [Mrs. Zhang].
[Mrs. Zhang], with red eyes, gives you a "handwritten letter" written by [Yue Luo] (you sisters often correspond, so you will naturally recognize the handwriting). The main message of the letter is: If I die, I will ask Mrs. Zhang took care of it. I only trusted her. On September 2, my sister came back and asked Mrs. Zhang to pick up her niece from the ferry.
Then [Mrs. Zhang] tells you another tragedy - your younger sister [Yue Luo] committed suicide by taking poison last night (September 1st)! You can't believe it. You asked [Mrs. Zhang] to take you to the town to see the body immediately, but [Mrs. Zhang] still has to pick up people and cannot return to "Baoshu Town" immediately. So you waited anxiously at the ferry until dusk, watching the river turn red. The last ferry had finished its work, but you still didn't see the person [Mrs. Zhang] wanted to pick up.
During this period, you and [Mrs. Zhang] didn’t talk much. After your father died, your younger sister suddenly committed suicide. A series of things happened that you couldn’t accept, and your mind went blank. Maybe, you can only believe that it was all true when you saw the corpse. Really... [Mrs. Zhang] Seeing that it was getting late, he said that the train might be delayed, so he drove you back to "Baoshu Town" - you insisted on going to the "cemetery" first on the way, [Mrs. Zhang] had no objection.
When it got dark, you two women came to the "cemetery". You first found your father's tombstone in the family cemetery of the "Ge family". You held back the tears all the way and then burst out... You After crying for a long time, [Mrs. Zhang] also cried softly on the side. After that, you went to see the body of [Yueluo] in the coffin in the temporary funeral shed and confirmed the death of your younger sister. Only then did you finally Believe everything is true!
It took you a long time to stop crying. The weather in the town is hot at this time. You only know that your younger sister has always been spoiled and is especially afraid of flies, so you asked [Mrs. Zhang] to help close the coffin lid. Then you say goodbye to the deceased again and return to the car.
When [Mrs. Zhang] drove to the door of "Zhang's House", she met [Le Wan] - she said she was waiting for [Mrs. Zhang] here. When she saw you get out of the car, she came over to help you get your "suitcase". Because you didn't Knowing her, but not used to being served by servants, I waved my hand and refused - you are eager to return home at this time, [Le Wan] and [Mrs. Zhang] will walk you back to the "Ge family" together.
You return to this familiar "Ge family" mansion and see that the hall has been decorated as a mourning hall, with only candlelight. There is not a single familiar face in the house, not even the old butler [Fu Bo] who has watched your sisters grow up, and the cook who cooks delicious food. The old cook [Uncle Xi] has all left - you think of Xi Mei’s letter mentioning that she hates these incompetent servants, and you can’t help but sigh...
You didn't need anyone to accompany you. You took your "suitcase" and went upstairs alone. First, you went to see your father's and younger sister's rooms. The rooms were decorated as they had been after they passed away. You looked at everything in front of you. For more than ten years, All the past events from the past are flooding into my mind at this moment·
Do you remember that before you left the "Ge Family", [Yueluo] often accompanied her father to the "Wild Deer Forest" for hunting - she had a deer cub that she had raised since childhood, and escaped back to the forest, and [Yueluo] ran to "Yutou Mountain" "In pursuit of it, he accidentally lost his way and was injured. After being found from the other side of the mountain, he cried and asked his father to catch the deer cub and come back. At that time [Zhang Junshi] of the "Zhang family" was out When you came back from studying medicine, you were asked to prescribe medicine for [Yue Luo] to treat her injuries. He jokingly called you and [Yue Luo] "Mandala sisters".
Later, you read [Yue Luo] a book brought by [Zhang Junshi] to [Yue Luo] beside the hospital bed. At night, she held your hand and made you swear to her: You will stay with [Yue Luo] for the rest of your life. ······After [Yueluo] recovered, she still remembered to ask her father to summon all the hunters in the town to the "Wild Deer Forest" and catch many deer cubs for her...
You put down your luggage in the room, took out your things and put them away, then walked to the window - you could see the gate of the "Ge Family" from the window, where a carriage was parked (you remember when you came in with Mrs. Zhang and the others just now) , there is no such carriage outside yet), then suddenly a person rolled out of the carriage, fell to the ground, and was picked up by another person (you can’t see clearly what they did), and then three people walked together outside the door Enter the "Ge family". You walk downstairs immediately - as the only person in the "Ge family" at this time, you must face what happens next.


Act 3:
You are the real murderer! You are actually still [Ge Yueluo], you pretend to be your sister [Yueman] - after your father died, you suffered from insomnia due to sadness and no one around you. When you went downstairs, you overheard your husband arguing with someone else (Lü Songnian), each other Accusing the other party of using too harsh torture to kill "Old Man Ge"... Your husband said that "Old Man Ge's" daughter must have known that he could be kidnapped and tortured as usual, but [Lü Songnian] disagreed because he was afraid of him The attack was too harsh. Killing one more person would completely cut off the clues, and [Xue Dacai] and the others couldn’t be suspicious of this matter... You heard that your limbs were cold (you only know that Zhu, Lu, and Xue are staring at it now) "Ge family" (I don’t know how many similar people there are, and I don’t know how much patience they have left), can no longer sleep peacefully - after waking up with screams again and again, you finally understand: only by getting rid of all the people who scare you, To get rid of this nightmare! The only person who can help you is your sister [Yueman] - you must find her back!
In fact, [Yueman] did not marry far away, but eloped with [Zhang Junshi] and went to Shanxi to join a cousin of the "Feng family" - your grandfather [Ge Wanli]'s original surname was "Feng", which was "Feng". The youngest son of the "Feng family" was adopted by the couple "Ge Ansai" who lost their only son in the war. Later, "Ge Wanli" moved to "Baoshu Town" and still had contacts with the "Feng family" who moved to Shanxi. You and My sister knows these family secrets. In order to cover up his ugliness, my father only announced that his eldest daughter was married to Tianjin. Over the years, my sister had been sending letters home.
You wrote a letter to tell your sister about the situation, and she returned to "Baoshu Town" disguised as [Mrs. Zhang]. You drove away all the servants at home and replaced them with new ones. This was also to prevent your sister from leaking the news when she came to visit. ·····After you sisters met, you suppressed your grief and plotted to avenge your father - you pretended to be sick to let your enemies relax their vigilance, and it was also convenient for your sister to visit and deliver medicine as an excuse to visit and make plans (the following is the truth you know) -You and Mrs. Zhang lied before).
August 30th. You and [Mrs. Zhang] used "ether" to stun [Zhu Lingshan] outside the "Zhang Family" door, and hid in the carriage of the carriage (the car at this time did not have a trunk. If you put people in the back seat to transport people, it is very likely that be seen), then [Mrs. Zhang] will drive you to the "Mountain Pavilion", and then drive back (according to the plan, she will find someone to drive a carriage over, and you will stun the person again and serve as witnesses in the next steps) . After that, [Xue Yufan] drove [Mrs. Zhang] over in a carriage. You used "ether" to stun him from behind, and you and [Mrs. Zhang] worked together to drag [Xue Yufan] into the nearby old house of the "Ge Family" and tied him outside. Then drag the [Zhu Lingshan] in the carriage and the "animal skins" used to cushion the seats into the old house, and tie the people in the back room. Then you find the "shotguns" and ammunition stored in the old house, and wrap them up , left the carriage and walked home (Mrs. Zhang hid the "shotgun" and ammunition in the car after returning).
In the evening of September 1st, you and [Mrs. Zhang] acted together (just using Le Wan as a witness), and left a handwritten letter entrusting [Mrs. Zhang] to handle the funeral affairs and pick up [Ge Yueman] (this is The letter was later destroyed by you), when you are alone, take a calculated dose of the "suspended death medicine" (Mrs. Zhang brought it in a "pill bottle" before), and take the entire bottle that [Mrs. Zhang] brought Pour the "painkillers" into the empty "pill bottles" that originally contained the "suspended death medicine", carry them close to your body, and then smash the "red bottle" that originally contained the "painkillers" - you feel the effects of the medicine taking effect and are afraid you will never wake up again. Come on, inexplicable fear makes your face distort, you curl up your body subconsciously, and you quickly lose consciousness, as if you are really dead...
On September 2nd, you were put into a coffin and sent to the "cemetery" for burial. [Mrs. Zhang] drove to pick you up. Before she left town, she sent [Lü Songnian] and [Xue Dacai] the letters you wrote in advance. "Note". In the afternoon, you wake up from anesthesia, climb out of the coffin, find the "shotgun" hidden in the coffin (Mrs. Zhang arranged it when buying the coffin), close the coffin lid, and hide near the ancestral grave of the "Xue Family", you will be deceived. Kill [Lü Songnian] who comes to the "cemetery" (according to the time of death, you, as Ge Yueman, and Mrs. Zhang are not in town at this time). Then you ran from the path under "Yutou Mountain" to "Wild Deer Forest" (you used to hunt with your father and you are familiar with this place). When you saw [Xue Dacai] who came to see your son, he was shocked when he recognized you and turned around to run away. , you shot him from behind! (You hid it from my sister, not only did you want to avenge your father, but you also wanted to kill all these people who targeted the "Ge family")
After that, you go back to the old house to torture [Zhu Lingshan] (cut off his hand skin), and as soon as you ask [Yu Shangyong] (Zhu Lingshan said that he may also be eyeing the "Ge family"), [Zhu Lingshan] will be in pain to death, you Feed him half a bottle of the "painkiller" you carry with you - [Zhu Lingshan] and he will soon fall into coma and then die. While crying, you untied the rope, threw down the "shotgun", forged a suicide note, pretended that [Zhu Lingshan] had killed his enemy, and then committed suicide - you desperately longed for others to have unforgettable true love for you, and that's why " Self-deception”….
That night, [Mrs. Zhang] drove to the old house (she pretended to pick you up at the pier), and you woke up [Xue Yufan] in the outhouse (blindfolded his eyes and blocked his mouth), so that he could hear you and your family Sister loudly replayed the conversation on September 1st, and then shouted: "Zhu Lingshan, what are you doing? Let me go first...don't kill me, I don't even know! (Don't kill me, I Don’t know anything)” Then you poured all the “ether” in the “medicine bottle” on a piece of cloth, smashed the “medicine bottle”, and screamed, and then [Xue Yufan] saw the “candle” and the “beast” "Pi", you use "ether" to stun him again, put him into the carriage, loosen the reins, and use the characteristic of "an old horse knows the way" to let the horse-drawn carriage return to "Ge's house" - [Xue Yufan] After waking up, he will definitely Supporting the death of [Ge Yueluo]!
Then you put the "candles" and "animal skins" into the "suitcase", go outside to cut your long hair short, put on the clothes and makeup prepared by [Mrs. Zhang], and drive back to the "Zhang Family" in front of the carriage. "(You made up the story of going to the "cemetery"), and then walked back to the "Ge family". You took the "suitcase" upstairs and arranged a scene similar to what [Xue Yufan] knew next to the bedroom (" Candle" and "hide")······
On September 3rd, you have been at the "Ge family". In the morning, [Mrs. Zhang] brought [Le Wan] to see you (you invited Mrs. Zhang to attend Yue Luo's funeral yesterday), and you continued to pretend to be [Ge Yueman], Maintaining your previous relationship with [Mrs. Zhang], you both wore black veils because your eyes were red and swollen (in fact, to avoid being recognized). After some pleasantries upstairs, you led the servants from your family to "Cemetery" began to hold a burial ceremony for [Ge Yueluo].
You cried loudly in the "cemetery", [Mrs. Zhang] kept persuading you, and then watched the hired people carry the coffin from the funeral shed to the "Ge family" family cemetery (located south of the entrance to the cemetery), and buried it Underground... After that, the funeral began according to custom, paper dummies and gold and silver were burned, and new tombs were piled up amid wailing.
In the afternoon, after the funeral, you put away your tears and saw [Xue Yufan] holding a "rifle" and grabbing [Lü Lusheng] on the way back to "Ge's house"... an argument with [ [Yu Yancheng] A burly man (Yu Shangyong) who looks similar comes from a distance.

Act 4:
On September 3rd, you left the "cemetery". [Mrs. Zhang] didn't say a word along the way. She asked [Le Wan] to go back first, and then she followed you back to the "Ge Family" in a room with no other people. Asked if you killed [Xue Dacai]?
You didn't hide it. My sister was frightened by your calmness. She said that this person was not the enemy who killed my father. Why did you...you didn't wait for my sister to finish speaking, grabbed her arm and asked me to Sister, don't be naive - these people are eyeing the "Ge family". If you don't kill them, they will definitely be killed by them!
My sister is still shaking her head - you actually asked from [Zhu Lingshan] that they were asking Abba about the whereabouts of "Mrs. Wisteria". You once heard Abba say that when my sister eloped, she stole "Wisteria" from home. Madam"... You don't know why those people are looking for "Mrs. Wisteria", and you don't even remember what "Mrs. Wisteria" is. You only know that Abba was tortured to death without telling [Zhu Lingshan] the secret. That's In order to protect the safety of her daughter who is thousands of miles away, my sister doesn't care. Until now, she just wants to stay away from it all and go back to live her happy life full of love. My sister said that when [Zhang Junshi] comes back, she will send her niece off together. Zhi Jun] I went to Guangzhou and will never come back...
My sister's determination is just like the night she left town - you feel the pain of a knife again... What makes you even more chilling is that my sister also asks you not to hurt other people, otherwise she will Say everything! You can't believe it - your sister used to be your only support, but now she no longer supports you! [Mrs. Zhang] After walking out of the "Ge family", you burst into tears - you hated your sister just like you hated the deer cub that escaped from you...
Today (September 4) is the Ghost Festival (the fifteenth day of the seventh lunar month). According to custom, the "Ollan Festival" is held under the "Baoshu Pagoda". However, in the past few months, people have been missing and killed. The town has People are panicking.
After you get up, go to "Zhang's house" to find your sister (the carriage is still at Ge's house). The person who opens the door is a girl with long hair tied back, claiming to be [Mrs. Zhang]'s niece [Zhi Jun]  (I don’t know you, it’s probably because my sister didn’t tell her about your relationship and plans), and then she said that [Mrs. Zhang] drove [Le Wan] and [Yu Yancheng] out, probably to eat and drink... ··You said goodbye outside the "Zhang Family" door. Under the watchful eyes of [Zhi Jun], you walked back to the "Ge Family". You felt abandoned and lonely again, and the wound in your heart cracked deeper...
At noon, you really wanted to see your sister, so you left "Ge's House" and walked all the way to the east of the town, only to see [Mrs. Zhang's] car outside "Lü's Tavern". You pushed the door open and came in, and saw Mrs. Zhang alone in the tavern, sitting at the table by the window (there were three pairs of chopsticks and three empty wine glasses on the table). You walked to the table, unable to control your voice, and asked her tremblingly if she would like to stay with you and help you kill the last "bad guy" (Yu Shangyong)? [Mrs. Zhang] Please stop talking, she will not change her mind, let alone allow you to kill anyone again!
You picked up an empty wine glass on the table and walked to the counter. Tears blurred your eyes. You pretended to pour the wine and took out the "medicine bottle" you brought with you. In it was the remaining half bottle of "analgesic" containing "opium". "Medicine" - you put the medicine into the wine glass, throw away the empty "medicine bottle", fill the glass, take it to your sister, and whisper that if she decides not to help you anymore, she will drink this glass of wine... ····【Mrs. Zhang】 took the wine and drank it in one gulp. Your tears flowed down at this moment.
[Mrs. Zhang] soon felt something was wrong. She held the table hard but couldn't control her body. At this time, [Yu Yancheng] pushed the door in with "game". You immediately explained that you were drinking together, [Mrs. Zhang] 】Suddenly poisoned - [Mrs. Zhang] wanted to speak at this time, but could not make a sound - You were afraid that your flaw would be seen, so you immediately shouted to [Yu Yancheng]: There is a kind of "Lobelia" on the other side of "Lianhua Stream" ( You heard my sister say), you can pick it back and detoxify it! The young man did not hesitate, threw down his "shotgun" (gun) and "game" and ran out... Then you watched [Mrs. Zhang] lying on the table, fell into a coma, and then died.
You wiped away your tears and said goodbye to your sister - this is all her fault, she has failed you, Abba, and the "Ge family"... Since you were a child, it has always been your sister who is sorry for the "Ge family", sorry for the "Ge family" Abba...
You suddenly remember that you cannot let [Yu Yancheng] tell what he just saw - he has no doubt, but others may not believe it so easily - you untie the game from the "shotgun" and throw it on the ground next to the counter , picked up the "shotgun" and chased out.
You closed the door when you left the tavern, chased to "Lotus Creek", and shot and killed [Yu Yancheng] who had just witnessed everything - with the sound of "bang", the boy was shot in the head, and his body fell in a pool of blood, his hands He held a handful of "Lobelia" tightly... Then you threw the murder weapon (shotgun) into the stream and left quickly.
You return to the outside of the tavern and see [Zhi Jun] standing in front of the door, not yet entering. You go over and open the door of "Lu's Tavern" and see [Yu Shangyong] holding [Le Wan]'s hands in the tavern, and [Mrs. Zhang] lying on the table by the window. You go to help her up and see The person was no longer breathing, so he screamed and fell to the ground... With the sound of things breaking, [Lü Lusheng] crawled out from behind the counter, with blood still bleeding from his head... ·[Xue Yufan] also ran in from the door. He looked flustered and had grass on his body... (Zhi Jun doesn't know the secret between you and "Mrs. Zhang" - she won't help you, you have to Get rid of all suspicions on your own - fortunately "Mrs. Zhang" has been testifying for you before, and the identity of "Ge Yueman" will also help you hide the truth...)
