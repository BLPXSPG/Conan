In Guangdong Province in the south, there is the "Guangsan Railway", which was completed and opened to traffic in 1903. It connects Guangzhou and Foshan to the "Sanshuihekou Station". Get off the train here, then cross the "Xijiang" to the west, and then enter a Luxurious Mountains - One of them is "Baoshu Town" hidden in the mountains and forests. The entrance of the town is nearly 2 hours' walk from the ferry of "Xijiang". There is only one road leading in and out of the town. The population of the town is concentrated in the center of the town. Among them, the "Ge family" has the largest business - the head of the family, Ge Jixian, has served as the town's mayor. "Bao Chang" gave birth to two daughters. The eldest daughter, Ge Yueman, married away from Tianjin. The younger daughter, Ge Yueluo, was left behind and hired Zhu Lingshan, a foreigner, as his son-in-law.
Three months ago, Ge Jixian was kidnapped by bandits, and only a corpse with its right ear cut off, all teeth missing, and hands and feet broken was found. It was so horrific... Ge Yueluo was distraught and angered the whole world. House slaves, drive these people out of the "Ge family"...
At that time, no one could have thought that this was just the beginning of the tragedy in "Baoshu Town" - it all started on September 1, three days ago. ． ． ． ． ．

Act 1:
your story
(Please do not read the script directly during the game. When acting, you must conform to the character's personality. You can add content that is not written in the script on the basis that it does not violate the character setting)
Your name is [Le Wan]. You were born in 1885. Your ancestral home is Guangxi. Your parents have passed away long ago. A few years ago (1905), your hometown suffered a natural disaster. You were helpless and had no choice but to leave your hometown and came to "Baoshu Town". , you are penniless and can only live on the street. Thanks to meeting the old butler of the "Ge family" [Fu Bo], who takes you in as a servant, you have a place to stay away from hunger and cold - you will be in the "Ge family" from now on. When doing things, you should strictly abide by the rules of dignity, bow your head and obey orders. No matter whether you are cleaning at the beginning or helping in the kitchen later, you are very attentive and secretly save some wages.
On June 2 this year (1914), in the evening, you saw someone stuffing a piece of paper on the door. It said: "The Chaohu King invited Mr. Ge to go up to the mountain to stay for a few days. He will return it to the person afterwards without any compensation." Officer!" You were so frightened that you ran up to the second floor and went to [Ge Jixian]'s room. When you saw [Ge Yueluo], you handed the paper to her. After reading this, [Ge Yueluo]'s face was distorted and she was trembling all over. She called her husband [Zhu Lingshan] and sternly ordered him to go out and inquire. At this time, [Ge Yueluo]'s voice became particularly sharp because of fear, and [Zhu Lingshan]'s face It was also pale.
You stayed in the room, but [Ge Yueluo] didn't pay attention to you at all. She stared at the door until [Zhu Lingshan] came back and told her that "Chaohu King" was the name of the bandit... The next few days In the sky, the whole "Ge family" was shrouded in unrest. Everyone who came close to [Ge Yueluo] was scolded by her as useless, even her husband [Zhu Lingshan] was no exception.
On June 7, hunter [Yu Shangyong] discovered the body of [Ge Jixian] in the "Wild Deer Forest". It was said that it was horrific... [Ge Yueluo] was even more devastated after he came back after identifying the body. Even during the day, he could not see the corpse. Hang up the curtains and light candles before it gets dark... Not only that, [Ge Yueluo] often wakes up at night and screams at people, scaring you so much that you dare not sleep peacefully. Fortunately, [Zhu Lingshan] is considerate. Servant, please arrange that you all go back to the servant's room outside the mansion to spend the night, leaving him alone to take care of his wife in the mansion.
[Ge Yueluo]'s situation became worse and worse. One day at the end of June, she lost her temper even more. No matter how many years they had served in the "Ge family", regardless of whether they were old or young, she drove them all away without mercy - you again With nowhere to go, I stood on the road with my luggage, at a loss. [Zhu Lingshan] sympathized with your situation and took you in a carriage to Orion's "Yu's House" in the east of the town, renting a wing room for you to stay temporarily. There are only two brothers [Yu Shangyong] and [Yu Yancheng] in the "Yu family". They are both good people. They go out hunting before dawn and pay homage to the "ancestral tablets" when they come back. You prepare prey, cook for them, and eat together. You usually help wash and mend clothes and clean the house.
This stay was not long, and soon [Zhu Lingshan] found a new job for you - two months ago (July), the heir of the "Zhang Family" not far from the "Ge Family" [Mr. Zhang] brought his wife back to the town, and he also brought a brand-new "car" for his wife (Mrs. Zhang) to travel around the town, which caused a sensation.
Because the "Ge family" and the "Zhang family" have old friendships, and the "Zhang family" is recruiting servants, [Zhu Lingshan] introduced you there and became your guarantor. [Mr. Zhang] is a doctor. Hearing [Zhu Lingshan] praise you for your hard work, gentleness, and ability to speak "Mandarin" (the Mandarin from the late Qing Dynasty to the Republic of China, which you learned from your family since childhood), he agreed to keep you. He teaches you some nursing knowledge every day and plans to train you to become an assistant in his private clinic.
On the morning of August 30, you saw [Mrs. Zhang] write a letter and give it to [Yu Yancheng] who came to deliver the game.
At noon, [Zhu Lingshan] drove his wife [Ge Yueluo] to the "Zhang Family" in a carriage, but there was an argument outside the door. You quickly went into the house and told [Mrs. Zhang] about the situation, and she asked you to prepare tea in the house. But he didn’t take [Ge Yueluo] into the house - In the afternoon, you saw the car parked outside the door of the "Zhang Family", and the carriage of the "Ge Family" had already left. After a long time, [Mrs. Zhang] walked home alone. Come.
On September 1st, [Mrs. Zhang] went to "Ge's house" to see [Ge Yueluo], and [Yu Yancheng] came to "Zhang's house" to see her. You told him that [Mrs. Zhang] went to "Ge's house", [Yu Yancheng] Yancheng] Please take him to the "Ge Family" - You saw that the young man in front of you was sweating profusely, and you thought there might be something urgent, so you took him to the "Ge Family" immediately...

Act 2:

On September 1st, in the evening, you stayed with [Mrs. Zhang] at the "Ge Family". [Ge Yueluo] kept saying that she was in pain, and then burst into tears. The servants of the "Ge Family" stayed away from each other. You and [Ge Yueluo] kept away from each other. Mrs. Zhang] comforted her and helped her up to the second floor and back to her room. [Ge Yueluo] seemed to be unconscious at this time, and kept shouting: "I hurt, my body hurts...Abba was killed..." Then she pulled [Mrs. Zhang] , begging her to get the "special medicine", [Mrs. Zhang] will leave you to take care of [Ge Yueluo], and she will go back to "Zhang's house" to get the medicine.
[Yue Luo] was a little more emotionally stable at this time and wrote a letter, asking you to hand it to [Mrs. Zhang] after you get home. Then she lay back on the bed and fell asleep after a while. As soon as you breathed a sigh of relief, [Ge Yueluo] suddenly opened her eyes wide and shouted loudly: "I'm going to die, I'm going to die!" Then she started to tremble. You went over immediately, but she stretched out her hands to strangle you, so you had no choice but to grab them. She pinned her down on the bed and called her name repeatedly - [Mrs. Zhang] came back from getting the medicine and immediately asked you to let go. Just as you were about to explain, [Mrs. Zhang] asked you to shut up and leave. here. You walked out of the room and heard [Ge Yueluo] shouting: "Give me the medicine quickly!" Then [Mrs. Zhang] shouted: "You can only take one mouthful of this medicine. If you take too much, you will die." !”
You stood outside the door, and soon [Mrs. Zhang] came out. You hurriedly explained to her that [Ge Yueluo] looked very scary just now, shouting that she wanted to commit suicide, so you went over and held her down... Mrs. Zhang comforted you and asked you not to go in and disturb [Ge Yueluo] while she went downstairs to get water.
After [Mrs. Zhang] went downstairs, [Ge Yueluo] quietly opened the door - her eyes were red and she was holding a "red medicine bottle" in her hand, asking you to call [Mrs. Zhang] to come up, you said [Mrs. Zhang] 】Go get the water and you'll be back soon. [Ge Yueluo] yelled, "She didn't turn over (she didn't come back), let me order some medicine (how do I take medicine)? Go find her immediately!" You hurried downstairs and found yourself in the kitchen outside the mansion. I found [Mrs. Zhang] inside and said [Ge Yueluo] wanted you to come find her. You both returned upstairs, pushed the door open and entered the house. You saw [Ge Yueluo] curled up motionless on the bed, her face twisted and painful, and there were already things lying on the floor. The broken "red medicine bottle" was already empty. [Mrs. Zhang] walked over to check and found that [Ge Yueluo] had stopped breathing...
Everything happened so suddenly. You went downstairs to the kitchen to find [Mrs. Zhang]. She had just poured a glass of boiling water. After it cooled down a little, she came back with it. [Ge Yueluo], who was alive just now, was already dead... ····You remember the letter that [Ge Yueluo] asked you to give to [Mrs. Zhang] after you go home, and immediately take it out and tell [Mrs. Zhang] that [Ge Yueluo] just asked you to give it to her. [Mrs. Zhang] Read the letter with you. The main idea is: If I die, I will ask Mrs. Zhang to take care of all my funeral affairs. I only trust her. When my sister comes back on September 2, I will ask Mrs. Zhang to pick her up at the ferry. I also took her back when my niece was born.
[Mrs. Zhang] After reading the letter, I will take you downstairs, gather the servants, and tell them what happened. You are very flustered at this time, and your mind is blank. All the things that happened in the "Ge family" before are all coming to mind. I wanted to find the head of the family [Zhu Lingshan], tell him everything, and let him make up his mind, but [Zhu Lingshan] did not show up, and no one in the "Ge family" knew where he had gone... ····
Fortunately, [Mrs. Zhang] is still here. She went out to buy a coffin for [Ge Yueluo] and asked someone to carry it back. The servants of the "Ge family" are hiding and dare not touch the body, so you can only help [Mrs. Zhang] to carry it back. The body was carried into the coffin and temporarily left in her room to rest. With fear, you and [Mrs. Zhang] put the body into the coffin and lay down together... This night, [Mrs. Zhang] You and I both stayed in the "Ge family".
On the morning of September 2nd, [Zhu Lingshan] was still missing. According to custom, [Mrs. Zhang] hired someone to carry the coffin to the family cemetery of the "Ge family" in the "cemetery", set up a funeral shed, and placed the coffin inside. , and took people to do a farewell ceremony.
At noon, the crowd dispersed. The new servants had no feelings for the "Ge family". They heard that they were insulted by [Ge Yueluo] every day, so naturally no one wanted to stay longer - you are different from these newcomers. The time in the "Ge Family" is not short, so I haven't slept a wink since last night. I was busy arranging various tasks and helping to decorate the hall into a mourning hall. When you see [Ge Yueluo] lying in the coffin, you can't help but feel sad and shed tears. ······[Mrs. Zhang] took you back to the "Zhang Family". Seeing that your eyes were red, she let you rest at home while she drove to the ferry to pick you up.
[Mrs. Zhang] After driving away, you lay on the table and slept for a while, but soon woke up because of the uneasiness in your heart. At this time, you felt uneasy, so you quietly went out to the "Baoshu Pagoda" - this tower has been abandoned for many years. Fortunately, the stairs still exist. You have seen [Zhu Lingshan] walking into the tower before. At this time, you don’t know his whereabouts. You can only hold on to the hope of giving it a try. You climbed to the top of the tower, but you still didn’t see anyone... ····
You felt very helpless. You hugged your knees and cried for a long time on the top of the tower. You finally stopped your tears. Looking out at the town from the window, you saw that the sunset had dyed the mountains red and the jackdaws were returning to their nests. You couldn't help but lose your mind... ·It is getting late, and you suddenly see two lights at the "town entrance", which should be [Mrs. Zhang]'s car lights.
You got off the tower and went back to wait outside the "Zhang Family" door, but you didn't see a car. After a long time, [Mrs. Zhang] drove back with a woman - you guessed this woman was [Ge Yueluo]'s sister [ Ge Yueman] - She has short hair, red eyes, and seems to have just cried. She is wearing a Western-style dress that cannot be bought in the town, holding a "suitcase" and a sunhat. Her appearance and temperament are similar to [Ge Yueluo] But completely different.
You said you were waiting for [Mrs. Zhang] here, and wanted to go over and help [Ge Yueman] get the "suitcase", but she refused, and then you and [Mrs. Zhang] sent her back to the "Ge family" - can you It can be seen that [Ge Yueman] is very anxious.
When you were in the "Ge Family" before, you rarely heard anyone mention [Ge Yueman]. After you came to the "Zhang Family", [Mr. Zhang] heard that you had worked in the "Ge Family" and chatted with you once. "The Ge sisters".
[Mr. Zhang] once jokingly called them "Mandala Sisters" and said that they were very different in terms of preferences and personalities. For example, [Ge Yueluo] liked to hunt with her father, but [Ge Yueman] did not even They can’t even fire a gun; another example is reading a book together, [Ge Yueluo] is intoxicated by the oath of love between young men and women in the book, but [Ge Yueman] admires the heroine’s courage to resist - [Mr. Zhang] laughed when he said this , and then said that as a medical student, he was only interested in the "poison" that the hero and heroine took when they committed suicide at the end of the book - he knew a "pharmacist" and after reading the story, he tried to make it· ·····
After you sent [Ge Yueman] back to the "Ge Family", she went upstairs alone, and you and [Mrs. Zhang] stayed in the hall that was decorated as a mourning hall. The candlelight flickered and everything was lifeless... You are When I didn’t know what would happen next, I saw [Yu Yancheng] supporting a [frail young man] (Xue Yufan) who looked similar to [Xue Dacai] and whose clothes were made of good material and walked into the "Ge Family" - Have you ever I have seen this [weak young man] go to "Zhang Family" to find [Mrs. Zhang], followed by the second shopkeeper of "Lü Family Tavern" [Lü Lusheng] (he looks similar to Lü Songnian), [Ge Yueman] has already put down I picked up my luggage and was coming down from the second floor.

Act 3:

You have concealed many things before and also told lies... Your real name is "Yan" and you are the wife of [Zhu Lingshan] Ming Media. Your grandfather [Yan Yichong] was an old member of the "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom". He was known as "One Sword Taiping" by people in the world. He was good at wielding a "Taiping" saber. He worked as a guard. His only apprentice was named [Wang Huchao] - a fierce bandit who later spread across Guangdong and Guangxi. "Tide Tiger King".
Your parents passed away very early, and your grandfather brought you up and taught you standard "Mandarin" from an early age. When you were 14 years old (1898), he chose [Zhu Lingshan] as your husband, and then said that he would tell you what happened back then. Everyone told [Wang Huchao] to find "that thing"... When you became an adult and married [Zhu Lingshan], you saw that your grandfather spent less and less time at home.
In 1904, the last time you saw your grandfather, he mentioned "Baoshu Town" and said that the whereabouts of "that thing" must be in the town... After that, your grandfather went out again. You see, your grandfather was already old at that time. Gao couldn't help but worry, [Zhu Lingshan] mentioned that he had been to "Baoshu Town", and there were cousins ​​in the town. He went there to find his grandfather, brought them back, and then [Zhu Lingshan] went out.
[Zhu Lingshan] After walking for half a year without any news, you really couldn't wait any longer, so you set off alone. After many twists and turns, you finally arrived at "Baoshu Town", but you found no trace of your grandfather at all... At this time, I ran out of money, so I applied for a job as a servant at the largest "Ge Family" in the town and stayed in the town.
In 1906, the second daughter of the "Ge family" [Ge Yueluo] hired a son-in-law. You didn't expect that the new uncle who moved into the "Ge family" was actually your husband [Zhu Lingshan] who had no information about him - he was in the "Ge family" He was also shocked when he saw you, and immediately asked you to keep quiet, and he would explain everything.
The reunion of your husband and wife became a shameful thing, but you still believed in [Zhu Lingshan]. He then took you to the "Baoshu Pagoda" and told you everything from the top... It turns out that two years ago A few years ago (1904), [Zhu Lingshan] met his grandfather at the "Lujia Tavern". At that time, his grandfather drank too much and only had time to tell him that the secret of the "Treasure of Heaven" was in a "Mrs. Wisteria" who hid it in the "Ge Family", the grandfather died before he finished speaking - [Zhu Lingshan] concluded that his grandfather had been searching for the "heavenly treasure" for decades, so he stayed in "Baoshu Town" and used his cousin [Xue Dacai] 】As a guarantee, he married into the "Ge family" just to find out the whereabouts of "Mrs. Wisteria"...
At this time, you just wanted to take your grandfather's body back to your hometown with [Zhu Lingshan]. Unexpectedly, [Zhu Lingshan] said that he could not remember the specific burial place. You burst into tears. [Zhu Lingshan] asked you to keep quiet and promised him He will soon be able to find the "Treasure of Heaven" and then take you away from here - he also said that this is the last wish of his grandfather before his death, and you must complete it! Then [Zhu Lingshan] swears to you that although he married [Ge Yueluo], he only has you as a good wife - if he lies to you, his hands will be ruined and his heart will be ruined, and he will die a good death!
You quickly covered his mouth. You had no idea in your mind. You could only stay in the "Ge family" and help [Zhu Lingshan] find "Mrs. Wisteria". Every night, you saw your husband going upstairs, so you could only secretly Crying, fortunately [Zhu Lingshan] sometimes goes to the "Baoshu Pagoda" with you for a tryst, but usually he tries his best to avoid [Ge Yueluo].
Several years have passed, and you have asked [Zhu Lingshan] to leave here more than once, but he always advises you to endure it a little longer... In order to make you believe him, he even brought out your grandfather's "Taiping" The saber, it is said that your grandfather personally asked him to search for the "heavenly treasure". This saber is the certificate that his grandfather handed it to him!
On June 2 this year (1914), the "Ge family" received a kidnapping letter from the bandits - you are afraid that [Zhu Lingshan] will be implicated (he was rushed by you before, please give him some time at the end, he will definitely be able to Find the "treasure" and take you back to your hometown) - You didn't tell anyone that you got up early and saw [Ge Jixian] getting on the carriage driven by [Zhu Lingshan] and going to the "cemetery".
Later [Ge Yueluo] drove all the servants out of the "Ge family", and [Zhu Lingshan] found a place for you to stay, and promised you personally that he would take you away as soon as he found the "treasure".
When you were at the "Yu Family", although [Yu Shangyong] didn't talk much, he took good care of you. If it weren't for [Lü Lusheng] from the nearby "Lü Family Tavern" who often came to spy on you while the "Yu Family Brothers" were out hunting. , you won’t leave in a hurry - thanks to [Zhu Lingshan] who came to visit you at that time, he heard that [Lü Lusheng] had evil intentions, so he brought you to the "Zhang Family", and even the luggage was sent by [Yu Shangyong] later." "Zhang Family" gave it to you.
On September 2nd, in the evening, [Mrs. Zhang] and you returned to the "Zhang Family" and fell asleep quickly.
On the morning of September 3rd, [Yu Shangyong], who looked similar to [Yu Yancheng], sent [Mrs. Zhang]’s niece [Zhi Jun] to the “Zhang Family”. [Mrs. Zhang] took her niece to the room and said some words. [Yu Shangyong] left in a hurry without waiting for [Mrs. Zhang] to come out and say thank you.
[Mrs. Zhang] has agreed to attend the funeral of [Ge Yueluo] today. I didn’t have time to say too much to my niece. I left her to settle her luggage at the “Zhang Family” and took you to the “Ge Family” - [Mrs. Zhang], [ Ge Yueman] and you put on black veils because the redness and swelling in your eyes had not gone away, and you were afraid of being seen and embarrassed. After chatting upstairs for a while, they led you and the servants of the "Ge family" to the "cemetery" , held a burial ceremony for [Ge Yueluo].
[Ge Yueman] cried loudly in the cemetery, [Mrs. Zhang] kept persuading her, and then you watched the hired people carry the coffin from the funeral shed to the "Ge family" family cemetery (located south of the entrance to the cemetery) for burial· ·····After that, the paper dummies and gold and silver paper were burned according to custom, and new tombs were piled up amidst the sound of wailing.
In the afternoon, after the funeral, on the way out of the "cemetery", you saw [Xue Yufan] holding a "rifle", grabbing [Lü Lusheng], and arguing... [Yu Shangyong] from Come from afar.

Act 4:
On September 3rd, you left the "cemetery" and still couldn't believe what you saw. This terrible tragedy did not suddenly appear without warning. You were even more worried about [Zhu Lingshan]'s safety... You Still haven't heard any news about [Zhu Lingshan] - [Xue Dacai] The handwriting on the "note" on the body seems familiar to you, but you dare not say it... [Zhu Lingshan] After his disappearance, you have been I was so anxious and had to pretend to be a stranger, which was very uncomfortable... You were on the top floor of "Baoshu Pagoda" before (September 2) and didn't see [Zhu Lingshan], so you started to have An ominous premonition kept lingering in my heart and lingered.
Afterwards, [Mrs. Zhang] sent [Ge Yueman] back to the "Ge Family". You returned to the "Zhang Family" alone, rummaged through your luggage, and found that your grandfather's "Taiping" saber was not brought over - you were in the "Yu Family" "When I was renting a house, I was afraid that someone would see my saber, so I wrapped it up and hid it on the side of the bed in the wing room where I lived. Of course [Yu Shangyong] didn't know about this, so he didn't bring the saber with him when he sent you your luggage. .
In the evening, [Mrs. Zhang] came back from the "Ge Family" with a tired look and told her niece [Zhi Jun] everything that had happened in the town these days. After that, [Mrs. Zhang] went to the medicine room, made sure there was no shortage of medicine as usual, locked the door, took the key with her (Mr. Zhang only left this key to the medicine room), and then told you that she was waiting for [Mr. Zhang] will take her niece to Guangzhou together after she comes back. She may never come back again.
Today (September 4) is the Ghost Festival (the fifteenth day of the seventh lunar month). According to custom, the "Ollan Festival" is held under the "Baoshu Pagoda". However, in the past few months, people have been missing and killed. The town has People are panicking.
In the morning, [Yu Yancheng] wore new clothes and came to the "Zhang Family". He wanted to invite [Mrs. Zhang] to have dinner with you. He also mentioned that his brother would be the owner of the tavern - their brothers planned to take over the "Lu Family Tavern". " and changed its name to "Yujia Tavern".
[Mrs. Zhang] liked this enthusiastic young man very much, so she agreed. You had something on your mind and didn’t want to go, but after [Yu Yancheng] whispered something to [Mrs. Zhang], [Mrs. Zhang] insisted that you go too, and you couldn’t refuse. [Mrs. Zhang]’s niece [Zhi Jun] chatted with [Mrs. Zhang] very late last night, and she may not have gotten up yet because she was tired from the trip, so you will leave her at the “Zhang family”.
At noon, [Mrs. Zhang] drove you and [Yu Yancheng] to the east of the town. [Yu Yancheng] said he wanted to hunt fresh game, so he asked [Mrs. Zhang] to drive him to take a detour to "Lianhua Creek" first, so that you can Go to "Lujia Tavern" and wait for them - you can see that [Yu Yancheng] and [Mrs. Zhang] are hiding something from you, and seeing that this place is not far from "Yujia", you want to get it back there I got off the car early to find my grandfather's relics, and after meeting them in the pub, I walked to "Yu's house".
You came outside the "Yu Family" courtyard, knocked on the door, and saw that the person who opened the door was [Yu Shangyong] - he even straightened his clothes when he saw you. You were a little embarrassed because you had been hiding the truth, so you whispered that something was left behind. At his house... [Yu Shangyong] asked you to come into the yard and took you to the wing where you lived.
[Yu Shangyong] suddenly asked you why you left. You said [Lü Lusheng] often came here to harass you when they were out hunting, and you didn’t dare to live any longer.
After that, you walked into the wing room. You lay on your side on the bed, reached under it, and touched the wrapped saber. You said even more embarrassedly: "Brother Yu, my things are here..." ." [Yu Shangyong] noticed something at this time, and suddenly shouted: "Who?" You immediately retracted your hand, and saw [Yu Shangyong] chasing him out, and you followed him into the yard - [ Yu Shangyong] picked up the wooden stick in the yard and chased him out the door.
You walked out of "Yu's House" and saw that [Yu Shangyong] had run away. You were afraid that something might happen to him, so you hurriedly chased after him - your steps were not fast, and by the time you ran along the road outside the "Lu Family Tavern", he had already disappeared.
You see [Mrs. Zhang]’s car parked outside the tavern, so you walk into the tavern and see [Mrs. Zhang] sitting at the table by the window. You ask [Yu Yancheng] where he is, [Mrs. Zhang] 】 He said that he went to the kitchen behind to cook game, so you brought three pairs of chopsticks and three empty wine glasses. Seeing that the wine in the jug on the counter was not very clean, you didn’t take it, and then you remembered that both [Yu Yancheng] and his brother were not good. When it comes to cooking, just ask for help.
You walked to the backyard and saw [Yu Yancheng] in the kitchen scurrying around, burning the meat - you couldn't help but smile, saying that I'd better leave this to you - [Yu Yancheng] scratched his head and asked you to put these things away. After throwing away the burned ones, he went out to get some "fresh ones" and came back, and then [Yu Yancheng] ran out.
[Yu Yancheng] After you go out, you find an apron to put on, cut off the burnt meat, and re-fry it. After you cook the dishes, you bring them from the kitchen to the front of the tavern. [Yu Shangyong] At this moment, he pushed open the door of the tavern and came in. When he saw you, he closed the door of the tavern, walked over quickly, and grabbed your hand, with a serious look on his face, as if he had something very important to say.
Your face became hot, and [Yu Shangyong] didn’t let go when he put the dishes on the counter. You looked to the side and saw [Mrs. Zhang] lying on the table by the window...
The door of the tavern was pushed open again, and [Ge Yueman] walked in with [Zhi Jun]. She went to help [Mrs. Zhang], but suddenly she screamed and fell to the ground... as things broke apart "Lü Lusheng" crawled out from behind the counter with blood on his head... [Xue Yufan] also ran in from the door. He looked panicked and had grass on his body... That feeling of foreboding comes back to you.
