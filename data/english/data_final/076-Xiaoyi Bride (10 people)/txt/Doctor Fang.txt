Your mother is not good, and you have no brothers. You can only interrupt your studies and go to the "Jiashantang" medical hall operating in Shanghai Pudong to help make money.I did not expect that the "Jiashan Hall" closed down soon. A senior in the medical hall introduced you to take care of the patient when you went to "Zhabei West Hospital"-very difficult time during that period. Fortunately, there is a letter from [ZHANG Decai].Less difficulties.
Three years later (1903), you received the last "letter" of [ZHANG Decai]. He said that he made a lot of money and would soon come to you and marry you.You take this "letter" as a treasure and wait for his appearance.Time has passed day by day, but [zhang decai] has no news from this ...

Three years ago (1911), your cousin [Tian Hongjiao] (she operated the tavern "Emerald Residence" at home, and the villagers called her "selling wine red" and would deal with guests very much.) (At this time Yao Changshou is the landlord, his age is enough to be his cousin's father).You attended the wedding banquet and drank too much on the banquet.

You know that the blood stains will be brown for a long time, and you will be afraid that the "worrying thing" has happened, and you will go to the terrace. By the moonlight, it is really blood-do you know that his father has already been killed-the murderer is to take the "map of the map to take away the" map map"Kill him.A "touch" sound came from the rooftop, a man fell from the sky and fell to you.You want to hide too much, a "object" fell to your feet.
