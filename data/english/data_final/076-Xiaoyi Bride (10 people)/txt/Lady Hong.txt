Character story
You are a native of "Baili Village", your real name is [Tian Hongjiao]. Because your family runs the pub "Jade Ju", you were once called "the wine seller Ahong". More than ten years ago (1900), a customer (Yao Changshou, much older than you) harassed you in the tavern. You beat him, and he led others to block the tavern, but was driven away by your fiancé [Fan Jinkui].
You introduced [Fan Jinkui] to take your brothers [Li Kuansheng] and [Li Guangsheng] to work for your uncle [Fang Chengshan]. Soon the "Li brothers" had an accident and [Fan Jinkui] also disappeared. You looked for him everywhere, and finally saw his decomposed and unrecognizable body in the woods north of the village. You could only identify the person from his clothes. After that, you were often awakened by nightmares and were very afraid of these "bad things" (ghosts or corpses). From then on, you made up your mind to live a good life no matter what happened. During this period, you had many drinkers to pursue, such as [Big -eyed Akun], [Guo Lizhu] and others, you regard them as passing by.
Three years ago (1911), [Yao Changshou], who was already a big landowner in the village, sent someone to bring you a betrothal gift. He also said that he wanted to marry you more than ten years ago, but unfortunately his wife was not dead at the time. [Yao Changshou]'s eldest son [Yao Mengren] comes to you and asks you not to agree to his father's proposal and leave here - if you agree, he will send you to the south to see the outside world. You have decided to marry into the [Yao] family at this time, and you want [Yao Changshou] to marry the matchmaker. 【Yao Mengren】Say you will regret it sooner or later! You know that he is the heir of the [Yao] family, and you don't dare to offend him.
After you married, [Yao Mengren] also got married, but he soon contracted a bad disease and died - [Yao Changshou] called his second son [Yao Zhongyi] home from outside, and buried [Yao Mengren]'s bones in Deep in the woods north of the village. [Yao Mengren]’s bride [Chen Junmeng] stayed there to observe mourning, and her maid [Chen Anqiao] was responsible for delivering meals every day. After your fiancé died, you were always afraid of entering the woods in the north of the village, and pretended to be sick on the day of the burial.
About half a month ago, someone saw "something bad" in the woods north of the village: a naughty boy ran in and didn't come out at night. [Yao Zhongyi] led people to find him - the naughty boy had become evil and kept telling people about him. Seeing a "ghost"... You were very frightened after hearing about it, and you remembered the death of your fiancé.
Also that night, [Yao Changshou] returned to the bedroom covered in dirt, and fell ill the next day - he looked older, lethargic, and the color of his skin and eyeballs was abnormal. You remember that he often left the bedroom at night and took a long time to come back.
When your cousin [Fang Minyue] (Fang Chengshan's daughter) attended your wedding, she mentioned that she was a female Western medicine doctor [Doctor Fang] from the "Zhabei Western Hospital" in Shanghai. You wrote to ask her to come and diagnose [Yao Changshou]. After her cousin visited the clinic, she returned to Shanghai to prepare two "high-priced medicines." After you paid the money, you found that you didn't have much cash at home, so you discussed with your husband that you wanted to sell a piece of land for turnover. [Yao Changshou] said excitedly after hearing this, there are treasures under the ground, and anyone who dares to sell them will be beaten to death! And scolded you out. After seeing this, your cousin will give you a bottle of "sedatives" and feed it to [Yao Changshou]. He will become emotionally stable and will no longer object to anything he says.
A few days ago, [Judy], a relative of [Yao]'s family, came to visit. He worked as a comprador in the Shanghai Concession and made a lot of money with foreigners. You received him warmly and mentioned that there was a piece of land at home that had been idle for many years (the woods in the north of the village, which you hated the most). You wanted to sell it for cash on the pretext of [Yao Changshou], and [Judy] agreed to help you find a buyer - he was worthy of it. He is a comprador, and he quickly found a buyer - he will stay at [Yao]'s house for a few days, waiting for the other party to come and see the land together. You arrange for him to live in a guest room with a balcony on the second floor (the railing between the balconies is not high).
(August 1) [Yao Zhongyi] brought a [mysterious man] wearing a "black jazz hat", covering his face with a "white scarf", and wearing a pair of "sunglasses" to stay in the guest room on the second floor.
Yesterday (August 2) afternoon
You and your cousin were chatting in the living room, [Yao Zhongyi] brought a young man, and your cousin said goodbye and went out. [Yao Zhongyi] introduced the young man as [Physician Yu] whom he invited to treat his father, and who also stayed abroad. You received him as warmly as you did when you ran the tavern, but you felt uneasy in your heart.
A [Short-haired Woman] came to the lobby with luggage. She was in her early twenties, wearing a light-colored suede leather jacket, long pants and leather boots, and holding a long package wrapped with "green cloth" (do you think it looks like this) a female bandit. She said she was looking for [Xu Boqing]. [Yao Zhongyi] got up immediately and took her to the second floor. You think [Yao Zhongyi] is planning something and you don’t dare to let [Physician Yu] see her husband now, so you make an excuse and say: "Physician Yu is coming from afar. Please rest for a night and then diagnose your husband tomorrow." [Physician Yu] He said he wanted to go shopping in the village, and you told him that "Jade House" is good (after you got married, you gave it to your sister A Cui to run it, and asked her to help you find someone to buy the land). Young people should try the "one of the things" there. Get drunk every day", but never go to the woods north of the village, there are "bad things" there.
You want to ask your cousin about your husband's condition, but she is not in the room (you knock on the door and there is no response), so you can only go downstairs - at this time [Chen Anqiao] leads the land visitor to the living room to meet you - the guest's name is [Hu Renyu], he didn’t counter-offer your offer. When you talked to him, you felt he was very reliable.
[Judy] came in sweating profusely. He was holding his coat and had a pungent smell. He greeted [Hu Renyu] and quietly asked you if any strange people came today. You told him about [Short-haired Woman].
【Judy】 said she felt unwell and left the living room. You and [Hu Renyu] chatted for a while. Because [Yao Changshou] didn’t take medicine now, you didn’t dare to let them meet, so you invited [Hu Renyu] to stay in the guest room on the second floor, saying that you would wait until [Yao Changshou] had rested before meeting in person. OK "deal".
You were just thinking about how to arrange for them to meet, [Yao Zhongyi] came in with a few people, including [Short-haired Woman], who sent the unconscious [Chen Junmeng] into the old house on the first floor (Yao Mengren's bedroom before his death). A [man with disheveled hair] named [Uncle Gui] claims to know medical skills and wants to help [Chen Jungmeng] check up. If you don’t find your cousin, go to the master bedroom on the first floor to take out all the medicine and accompany [Uncle Gui]. (Only you, Yao Zhongyi and your cousin have the key to the locked medicine cabinet. When you went in, you saw the cabinet door open and Yao Changshou sleeping).
After [Uncle Gui] checked [Chen Junmeng], you saw that he was very skilled in dispensing medicine, so you praised [Uncle Gui]'s medical skills and asked him to stay and diagnose [Yao Changshou] (you really want to diagnose at Physician Yu I need to know my husband’s condition and the cost of treatment beforehand). [Uncle Gui] said that he should go upstairs to check on [Physician Yu]’s condition first, and then come down for a consultation (only then did you remember that Uncle Gui was also brought in by Yao Zhongyi).
When it gets dark, [Uncle Gui] comes to see [Yao Changshou] - thick curtains are hung on the floor-to-ceiling windows in the master bedroom (Yao Changshou is afraid of light these days), and you bring a lamp and candle to light it up. [Uncle Gui] had just started seeing a doctor when [Yao Zhongyi] helped [Chen Junmeng] in. [Yao Changshou] suddenly became emotional and struggled up from the bed and said: "My Meng Ren is back...I saw He..."
You were frightened, the lamp in your hand fell to the ground, and flames burst out. [Yao Changshou] tore open his "diary" (he never let you read it), threw it into the fire, and [Uncle Gui] stepped on it No one spoke, only [Yao Changshou] looked at the "burnt paper" and kept muttering to himself: "I found it... You can't even think of taking it away..."
[Chen Junmeng] started crying, and [Uncle Gui] asked [Yao Zhongyi] to send her back. Only then did you calm down, and [Uncle Gui] said that she was tired today and would come back tomorrow to continue the diagnosis. You arrange for him to stay in the guest room on the first floor.
Yesterday (August 2) evening
In addition to looking at the watch or clock, the time in the game is an estimate, and there will be an error of about 10 minutes.
(21:30) You should prepare the "sedatives" that your husband will take before meeting [Hu Renyu] tomorrow. If you think about it, you will take them to the old house on the first floor in the afternoon. You go to the old room on the first floor to look for medicine and see [Chen Junmeng] with his eyes closed, groping for something. When you went to get the medicine, [Chen Junmeng] touched your hand, and she asked who it was, but you didn't dare to say anything, and picked up a "medium bottle with "calming" written on it" and went out.
(21:40) When you go to the kitchen and prepare to put medicine in your husband's food, you realize that what you are taking is not the usual "sedative", but you think that "soothing" means the same thing, so you take out the medicine, crush it, and put it in. On a plate of "Taihu Whitebait" (your specialty), the medicine didn't melt immediately, so you had to put the plate down.
(21:50) You walked into the old house on the first floor again, trying to get the "sedatives" you usually use, but you couldn't find them. 【Chen Junmeng】On the table next to him was the potion prepared by Uncle Gui.
(22:00) If you want to ask your cousin about medicine and your husband’s condition, go to the second floor to find her.
(22:10) You met your cousin in the corridor on the second floor and asked her about her husband's condition. The cousin said: "I diagnosed Yao Changshou's condition as very troublesome. He was eroded by the virus, resulting in abnormal skin and light pulse - to kill the virus , I can only rely on the special medicines from Western hospitals, which are very powerful and can handle any virus...but the price is not cheap!" You began to hesitate whether to continue spending money on treatment for your husband.
(22:20) The maid (not Chen Anqiao, she went to bed early and you never saw her at night) came to call you and said that [Uncle Gui] was waiting for you in the living room.
(22:30) You were worried about your husband's medical expenses. After going downstairs, you went to the master bedroom on the first floor and looked at [Yao Changshou] on the bed - he was sitting on the bed with dull eyes and wrinkled skin, which made you feel disgusted from the bottom of your heart.
(22:40) You came to the living room to see [Uncle Gui], and he asked you whether [Yao Changshou] had been to the woods in the north of the village before falling ill. You remembered that day when [Yao Changshou] came back covered in loess. It didn’t look like he had gone to the woods. The answer is no. At this time, you decided not to spend any more money on [Yao Changshou], and you had to keep the money from selling the land for yourself. You told [Uncle Gui] that [Yao Changshou] would get up early tomorrow morning to meet a guest (Hu Renyu), so why not? Please diagnose him.
(22:50) You said you wanted to get food for your husband and went to the kitchen.
(23:00) The drugged "Taihu Whitebait" disappeared from the kitchen, and you became anxious.
(23:10) You want to go to the second floor to ask the maid, but you pick up an unprecedented "long iron pipe with a wooden handle" at the top of the stairs. When you take it into the master bedroom, there is the sound of something falling to the ground outside the window. You feel scared and knock on [Yao Zhongyi]’s door, but no one responds. At this time, you heard someone in [Uncle Gui]'s room shouting: "Kill with a life!" You knocked on [Uncle Gui]'s door, but he didn't open the door while he was in the room. Instead, he asked you to wait outside for a while before opening the door to let you in. Room.
(23:30) You smell something burned in [Uncle Gui]’s room. You see [Uncle Gui] has injuries on his face, almost bleeding, and his eyes are wandering. You ask him if he has been in the kitchen, he replies no, and then suddenly he asks you loudly what time it is? You were startled and covered your mouth with your hands, realizing that your face was very hot. After you told him "the second hour of the Son" (23:30), you left with lingering fear.
(23:40) There is the sound of something falling to the ground outside the gate - you walk to the entrance, your heart is beating faster and faster - you don't dare to move anymore, squat on the ground, all kinds of scary pictures begin to appear in your mind...
(00:20) You meet [Hu Renyu] and he asks you what you are doing so late. You point to the door and say that you heard a noise there just now and you dare not go out to see it for fear of "something bad"... ·····
(00:30) [Hu Renyu] went out to check for you. There was a "bump" sound outside.
(00:40) [Hu Renyu] asked you not to come out, saying that there was a snake outside. After a while, he asked you to come out and take a look. You didn't dare to open your eyes, so you stuck your head out with your eyes closed, and then hid back immediately.
(00:50) [Hu Renyu] sends you back to your room to rest, and [Yao Changshou] stares at you on the bed and talks nonsense: "Meng Ren said he knows, baby, go and ask him..." Are you worried? [Hu Renyu] will talk to [Yao Changshou] about the land, and quickly let [Hu Renyu] go back to the room to rest, saying "deal" and wait until tomorrow.
(01:10) You feel very tired, but you can't fall asleep after going to bed. You are always agitated, and you even feel like there is someone outside the window... You don't know how long you have been struggling like this before you finally fall asleep.
This morning (August 3)
You woke up very early, went to the living room after washing up, and saw that [Yao]'s house was in a mess. [Short-haired Woman] said she found a body - the carriage did not leave the village last night, so the real murderer must still be hiding here. After hearing this, you were so panicked that you reluctantly sat down on the chair - you didn't want to see any corpses anyway!
