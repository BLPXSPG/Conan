Later, he took over the business of the wealthy businessman and became the head of "Farang Trading Company" big boss. Your unsatisfactory father [Chen Shitian], because he was a gambler and in debt, could only take you to live with relatives and become a
【Chen Qingwu】The servant of the family.
One winter, [Chen Shitian] drank too much, pulled you over as a teenager, and told you with a drunken breath that he discovered [Chen Qingwu]'s secret: "This guy has a treasure map, and I caught him. , so I took it out, but unfortunately there was only half of it..." You saw your father carefully taking out the "torn map (top)", and you thought it was just a graffiti.
At this time, you were already the maid of your cousin [Chen Junmeng]. She went out to play in the yard. You looked at it from a distance and saw a beggar outside. You didn’t dare to go over, but your cousin took out a piece of silver and gave it to the beggar! You told your father.
The father first asked his cousin to go back to the house, and then came out to call the beggar to return the money. The beggar was unwilling and your father called him despicable and defrauding children of their money! The beggar put the silver on the ground. When your father bent down to pick it up, he picked up a brick and hit him on the head hard. One time, another time... the blood stained the green brick red, and your father fell to the ground. You were so frightened that you huddled in the corner, speechless. The beggar plundered money and the "torn map (part 1)" from his father's body and walked away.
The murderer had been gone for a long time before you burst into tears. Your father's blood was bleeding all over the floor... After the government came to do an autopsy and issued a reward document, you only remembered a few yellow hairs in the beggar's chin. , is a young man, but these are of no help in chasing the murderer, and the cousin cannot tell the person's appearance at all. 【Chen Qingwu】After losing his temper that day, the matter was settled.
Three years ago (1911), my cousin married [Yao Mengren], the eldest son of [Yao Changshou], a large landowner in "Baili Village". They were children, and you went to [Yao]'s house as a maid. 【Yao Mengren】Before the wedding, the bride is required to wear "Platycodon flowers" and "Asparagus flowers". You don't know what the custom is, but my cousin complied with it.
My cousin came back after her wedding, and [Yao Mengren] asked you to accompany her back to Suzhou. Unexpectedly, he didn't show up until late at night after you went back, and he was still missing after a few days. [Chen Qingwu] asked you to send your cousin back to "Baili Village" as soon as possible. He gave you some money and asked you to come back by carriage and notify him immediately if you see anything happening - none of you expected it, [Yao Mengren] He died on the day he returned home!
[Yao Changshou] said that [Yao Mengren] suffered from a contagious illness and was immediately buried in a coffin after death. The cousin took off her red dress and put on mourning clothes, changing from a bride to a widow. [Yao Mengren]’s younger brother [Yao Zhongyi] also rushed back from where he went to school to attend the funeral.
[Yao Changshou] buried the bones of [Yao Mengren] deep in the woods to the north of the village (only the Yao family knew the way to get there from outside the woods, and it was your first time to go there): There was a vast forest in the woods. On the yellow land, a gray-white two-story foreign-style mansion was built on the ground. The outer walls of the mansion were covered with ivy. The tomb of [Yao Mengren] is built on the east side of the mansion and is made of bricks and stones. The stele in front of the tomb is engraved with the words "Tomb of Mengren, the unworthy son of the Yao family".
The front door of the mansion was firmly locked with a "big lock" with a special keyhole (flat keyhole) (there were remaining French paintings on the lock). [Yao Changshou] had people tear open the back wall of the mansion and arranged for [Chen Junmeng] lived in and kept filial piety, and asked you to be responsible for delivering meals every day. You were afraid of getting lost, so you carved a "mark" on the tree.
You took advantage of [Yao]'s family being busy, hired a carriage to go back to Suzhou, and reported the matter to [Chen Qingwu]. After hearing this, he paced back and forth and kept talking about "woods", "mansion", and "man named Fang". Finally, he gave you He brought reward money and a "wooden cage" with two homing pigeons, one white and one gray. He asks you to give the carrier pigeon to [Chen Junmeng] so that she can live in the mansion with peace of mind - this is probably where the treasure is hidden! If she discovered anything, she would immediately write him a letter and send it back to Suzhou by carrier pigeon. You did it all.
[Chen Qingwu] After receiving the letter, he puts the carrier pigeon into other "wooden cages" and you find an opportunity to bring it in. Sometimes you hang the "wooden cage" on the tree outside the mansion, [Chen Junmeng] After retrieving the carrier pigeon Leave the "wooden cage" empty, take it away and hide it in the room.
After that, you started living a life with two identities. One is the maid of the [Yao] family's mansion. Because of her cautious duty, she is trusted by [Yao Changshou]'s stepmother [Lady Hong]. The other is the contact person of [Chen Qingwu] and [Chen Junmeng], who travels between Suzhou and Suzhou. and "Baili Village", responsible for delivering messages and carrier pigeons - so you will quietly leave "Baili Village" in a horse-drawn carriage in the afternoon.
You are unwilling to live like this, and you are very envious of [Lady Hong]. At this time, you know that the second young master [Yao Zhongyi] and the deceased eldest young master [Yao Mengren] were not born to the same mother. His biological mother was the eldest wife’s maidservant. , the same as your identity.
You then had a bold idea. After [Lady Hong] and [Yao Changshou] got married, she was not pregnant. The current heir of the [Yao] family is only [Yao Zhongyi]. Although you are not a good match for him, but now It’s already the Republic of China, as long as he is willing to marry you, you can be like [Lady Hong].
Your only worry is that you don't have a chance. You often follow [Yao Zhongyi] and want to talk to him when no one is around, but he always goes to the woods alone - you just can't let him see what you are doing in the woods!
You then discovered that [Yao Changshou] would go to the woods every night. You followed him and found that he went to the grave outside the mansion. You were very scared and ran back quickly.
About half a month ago, you went to the woods to recycle, but you didn't see the "empty wooden cage" (sometimes Chen Junmeng would forget to hang up the "empty wooden cage"), so you had to go again at night. You see [Yao Changshou] in the woods at night, and he enters the mansion from the back - you know that only [Chen Junmeng] is in the mansion at this time.
You waited in the woods, and soon [Yao Changshou] ran out. The moonlight shone on his body, and it turned out to be somewhat fluorescent. You didn't dare to say anything, and you saw him running into the woods, and suddenly a child's scream came out. You saw [Chen Junmeng] coming out with an "empty wooden cage", and [Yao Changshou] hiding in the woods.
You used the light to signal [Chen Junmeng], but unexpectedly [Yao Changshou] was right behind her. He had already seen you and even wanted to catch you. Fortunately, the child ran away at this time, and there was the sound of other people talking in the woods-[ Yao Zhongyi appeared in the woods, and you quickly extinguished the candle.
You left the woods and were grabbed by [Yao Changshou] before you returned to the mansion. He was covered in loess and had a ferocious face, making you swear not to tell anyone about what you saw tonight, otherwise he would let you stay in the woods forever... You promised at that time that you wanted to escape back to Suzhou at dawn, but you didn't. Thinking of [Yao Changshou] suddenly falling ill the next day, [Lady Hong] asked a female Western doctor [Doctor Fang] to see him. You saw [Yao Changshou] sitting on the bed motionless after taking the medicine, not even talking. I couldn't explain it clearly, so I stayed with confidence.
You did not tell [Chen Qingwu] these things when you returned to Suzhou, but asked him for the reward - you are now convinced that the "treasure map" your father mentioned before he died is true, and [Chen Qingwu] and [Yao Changshou] are both there Look for it - you'll get it before they all!
Yesterday (August 2) afternoon
You rushed back from Suzhou and saw [Lady Hong] and [Doctor Fang] chatting in the living room, so you took the opportunity to go to the master bedroom on the first floor and saw [Yao Changshou] sleeping. You rummaged through his things and found out from one of his records, You were very happy to see a "torn map (Part 2)". Unexpectedly, [Yao Changshou] woke up at this time. You quickly put down your things and hid behind the cabinet containing medicine.
At this time you hear someone come in and come to get medicine, and then the person asks [Yao Changshou] about the baby in a very low voice (a woman's voice) - you can only hear [Yao Changshou] mentioning "secret" intermittently "Missing". [Yao Changshou] became excited: "Why do you ask him, who are you? Why do you ask him!"
At this moment, someone opens the door, and you take a peek and see a [mysterious man] wearing a "black jazz hat", covering his face with a "white scarf", and wearing a pair of "sunglasses", but you don't see the woman who is speaking. . [Mysterious Man] walked to [Yao Changshou]'s bed, [Yao Changshou] pointed at [Mysterious Man] and before he could speak, [Mysterious Man] covered his mouth.
You quickly retracted your head and listened to the [mysterious man] say: "You didn't expect that I would come back... Yao Changshou, who was so arrogant at the time, can only linger in bed now, how ridiculous it is - I advised you at the beginning, those treasures were originally It's just nonsense. You and Chen, the result of your conspiracy is not that you got nothing... You have got so much land, you should live out your old age honestly - the young wife is not bad. -You and I have different pursuits. I have my own goals, otherwise I would have come back long ago... I actually know what the treasure is - this is of no use to you anymore." You were shocked and confused after hearing this. Hi, when there was no sound in the room, you stuck your head out and saw that [Yao Changshou] was already lying on the bed, so you quickly came out.
You see a [Short-haired Woman] with luggage coming in from the gate. She is in her early twenties, wearing a light-colored suede leather jacket, long pants and leather boots, and holding a long package wrapped with "green cloth." She said she was looking for [Xu Boqing]. You didn’t know there was such a person in [Yao]’s family, so he took her to the living room and saw [Lady Hong] and [Yao Zhongyi] there, and there was a young man next to them. [Yao Zhongyi] introduced the young man to [Lady Hong] as [Lady Hong] Physician Yu]. [Yao Zhongyi] got up immediately after hearing [Short-haired Woman]'s intention and took her to the second floor.
You didn’t know what the relationship was between [Yao Zhongyi] and [Short-haired Woman], so you followed them quietly and watched them enter a second-floor guest room (the middle one with a terrace).
You return to the first floor, and there is a guest outside the gate. You take him to the living room on the first floor to meet [Lady Hong]. You hear them talking about selling the woods in the north of the village. You go to the inside and outside of the old house on the first floor (this was the bedroom of Yao Mengren and Chen Junmeng) and pretend to clean, still staring in the direction of the stairs. After a while, [Yao Zhongyi] went downstairs to the master bedroom. When he went back upstairs, you saw [Judy] secretly following behind - this person claimed to be a relative of the Yao family and had a good relationship with Lady Hong. He was left by Lady Hong to stay. Guest room on the second floor.
You were going to the woods to get the "wooden cage" - in order not to be seen, you always left the mansion through the back door and took a detour - but you didn't expect billowing black smoke and fire to rise from the depths of the woods. You saw the [mysterious man] picking up a carrier pigeon at the edge of the woods, and pulled out a "note" from the mailbox on the pigeon's leg. After reading it, he viciously threw the carrier pigeon to the ground the carrier pigeon was already dead, and there was no move, he stuffed the "note" into the "Black Jazz Hat" on his head, and walked towards the back door - you didn't know what happened, and you were afraid of being caught, so you hid back in the servant's room.
Yesterday (August 2) evening
In addition to looking at the watch or clock, the time in the game is an estimate, and there will be an error of about 10 minutes.
(21:50) You come to the rooftop and look out at the woods to the north of the village, which are still shrouded in black smoke, with sporadic firelight flickering in the depths.

(22:30) You heard someone shouting "Yao Zhongyi", followed by the sound of "touch"! You were frightened. When you heard no movement outside, you ran out quickly and almost stepped on a plate of "Taihu Whitebait" (Lady Hong's specialty) on a tray. You didn't dare to look at what was happening on the rooftop, so you ran down. ,
(22:40) You hide back in the guest room on the second floor, your heart pounding non-stop.
(23:00) When you hear someone talking on the balcony outside the door, you open the door and see [Short-haired Woman] holding a "rifle". Opposite her is a man wearing a "Black Jazz Hat" with " The [Mysterious Man], who covered his face with a "white scarf" and still wore "sunglasses" at night, also had a "rifle" in his hand. You quickly close the door. Then you hear a "ping" sound.
(23:10) You open a crack in the door and see a "rifle" on the ground at your door. You are very frightened and kick the "rifle" to the stairs, then hide in the house and close the door tightly. Soon you heard something falling to the ground from the balcony and someone talking, but you didn't dare to look.
(23:20) You open the door again and see that the "railing" of the balcony is gone, and [Physician Yu] is standing on the balcony - you suddenly remember that you saw him at the door of "Linchi Inn" when you returned to Suzhou. [Yao Zhongyi] went to pick him up. After they left, [Short-haired Woman] walked out of the inn - you hurried back to the house without being seen by him.
