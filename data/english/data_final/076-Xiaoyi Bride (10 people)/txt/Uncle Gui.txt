Character story
"I am the head of" Fanzhuang ", and I am killed by me ..." You read these words.For many years, you have been repeating the nightmare of the year, and the pain of remorse is ready to devour you at any time. You can only get rid of the drug temporarily.
Your real name is [DU Guicheng], and his family has been the head of the owner of the "Falun Village" (the master's surname Meng).You used to go to Shanghai to study medicine and want to do a career with a few friends. I did not expect that more than ten years ago (1900), your father [du Huixin] accidentally died.The following year (1901) became a murderer-when you were arrested, he already had your wife and children.
You have been detained in Shanghai for more than ten years, and you miss your wife and children every day, but you have never seen them again-not until long ago, you use the "knife" to hold hostages, escape from the place of detention, wear it outside the "prison uniform" outsideOn the robe, I went to the old friend's house and took the money and some drugs ("sleeping pills" and "medicinal opium". When you were detained, you were dependent on such drugs).A "old place" meet.
(August 1) You know that the police are looking for you everywhere, and you hid in the donkey car and escaped the city. The bumps stop for half a day. You came down from the car and came to the "Baili Village" not far from the agreed place-There is only one way to enter the village. There is a terrace in the north of the village, with a wooden forest-you remember the owner of "Falun Village" [Master Meng] in the "Baili Village".The commercial bank of the font size "Farang" has a group of important East Tibet in "Baili Village".You have been closed for too long, and the day when you repeat mechanical repeatedly made you forget a lot of things-you want to find these important things now-they must be very valuable, you owe too many wives and children, if you can prepare some compensation before meeting, you can prepare some compensation before meetingIt's so good.
You see that it is not too early at this time, so go to the village "Emerald Residence" (tavern) to rent a room.
Yesterday (August 2) afternoon
You get up early to search in the village. After walking for a long time, I met a smoker outside the "Bai Shuang Pavilion" and asked him a "foreign fire" (you intended to use the "medicinal opium" to ignite).The place where the hiding east is in the north of the village, it will pass immediately.
The forest branches are leafy. If you don't go far inside, you can see the rolling black smoke rolling in the depths of the woods, and the light of fire. A "white bird" rushes out of the black smoke.Outside the woods.You are afraid of the light, and turn around and run outside-there is a [Short-Haired Woman] to stop you and ask what happened to you?You are more nervous at this time, while trying to make a reasonable explanation, you can reach into your pocket to touch the medicine-you are afraid of your problems (medicine addiction).
You feel someone behind you, look back immediately, see a [young man], hold a [Long-Hired Girl] (he covers the girl's mouth with his hands, drags on the ground) out of the woods-they will hit you right away,You can't stand this sense of oppression, immediately support [Young Man], and see that he has fainted-you feel threatened and disappear before calming down.
[Short-Haired Woman] lifted up [Long-Haired Girl]. You see [Long-Hired Girl] pale face, closed eyes, look like poisoning coma.A [Fair-Skinned Youth] runs-he claims to be [Yao Zhongyi], is [Yao] the second master of the family, [young man] is the [Physician yu] he invited, and the coma [Long-Haired Girl] is his.Sister-in-law [Chen Junmeng], [Short-Hired Woman] is called [Yun Ling].
[Yao zhongyi] Get up [Physician yu] and ask what happened to you-you noticed that the arm of [Physician yu] was injured-your emotions at this time became very guilty, so you claim to be [UNCLE GUI] and understand some medical skillsYou can help.[Yao zhongyi] Please [yun ling] to help [Chen Junmeng] into a clean bedroom (old house on the first floor) on the first floor of the mansion, and he sent [Physician Yu] to the second floor.
You meet the hostess of the house [Lady Hong], she brought medicine to accompany you to the old house on the first floor.
When you diagnosed [Chen Junmeng], she woke up quietly, but said nothing.You told her that her eyes began to relax and cry due to "sulfur toxins" in dyeing "sulfur toxins", and there were "toxic visual dysfunction", and there were some burns, but as long as the treatment was timely, there would be no sequelae (Lady Hong brought by Lady HONG.The medicines include "boric acid solution" and "chlinomycin" -s are not expensive and effective. In addition, you noticed that there is a bottle of "sedative").When you reconcile the potion, you find that the container is not enough, and take out the "medicine bottle with" soothing "" (pretending to be your sleeping pills from the old friend's house), use the bottle cap to adjust the medicine, and look at the remaining "boric acid to boric acid after it is adjusted.The solution is not much and "galcin", so I threw it.
You help [Chen Junmeng] after applying the medicine (you put the medicine with a sleeping pill cap, and leave the sleeping pills without a lid), tell her to change the medicine for an hour, and it will be okay not to open her eyes for a few days.[Lady Hong] Praise your medical skills, please stay. Her husband is now sick and in bed, hoping that you can diagnose it.You are somewhat surprised by you to save people, which reduces your inner pain.You said that you should go upstairs to see the situation of [Physician yu], and go to her husband for consultation.
You took the bottle of "sedative" and went upstairs to see [Physician yu]. He woke up when you cleaned the wound on his arm, [Yao Zhongyi] for him, and thanked you, you quietly took ""The sedative "mix into the water to [Physician yu] to drink (Physician yu gives you a dangerous feeling, you feel unwavering when you look at his face), after seeing him sleeping, you told [Yao Zhongyi][Chen junmeng].
When it was dark, [Lady Hong] took you to the master bedroom on the first floor, and saw the [Yao Changshou] of the [Yao] family.[Lady Hong] Help you lift the lights, you see [Yao Changshou] look aging, mentally sluggish, "jaundice" in the skin color, and the color of the eyeball is not normal.At this time, [yao zhongyi] helped [Chen Junmeng] in, [Yao Changshou] was suddenly excited, struggling from the bed, "My Meng Ren is back ... I saw him ..."
[Lady Hong] The lights in their hands fell to the ground, the flames were rolling, and [Yao Changshou] tore off a "handwritten booklet" on his hand, throw it into the fire, and you quickly step on the fire.Everyone didn't speak, only [Yao Changshou] stared at "Burning paper" and murmured: "I found it ... you want to snatch it ..."
[Chen Junmeng] Crying, you asked [Yao Zhongyi] to send her back, remember to change the medicine tonight, you want to ask the cause of [Yao Changshou] sickness, but feel a while of fatigue (you think the drug addiction is fast outbreak.), Explain the diagnosis of the day.[Lady Hong] Arrange you in the first -floor room and give your room key.
Yesterday (August 2) evening
Except for clearing tables or clocks in the game, it is an estimated time, and there will be an error of about 10 minutes.
(22:00) You think the condition of [Yao Changshou] is similar to [Chen Junmeng], which are caused by "chemical toxin".You want to confirm where you go to the disease before the onset of [Yao Changshou].
(22:10) You asked a maid to invite [Lady Hong], and you go to the living room to wait for her.
(22:40) [Lady Hong] Come to the living room, do you ask [Yao Changshou] Have you been to the north of the village before the illness?She said she didn't seem to be considering what Lady Hong answered), and then [Lady Hong] changed the previous tone, saying that getting up early [Yao Changshou] to see a guest, you don't bother you diagnosed.
(22:50) You are strange, [Lady Hong] said to get food for your husband and leave the living room.
(23:00) You feel tired when you return to the room, and drug dependence makes you very uncomfortable.You take off the "prison uniform" and ignite the "medicinal opium" to suck, and fall into the unspeakable comfort.
(?:?) You are extremely relaxed, your behavior is not controlled, and the past that wraps around your heart also reproduces it. You first shouted "killing and compensating for life!"Many things, but I always remember the day when the killing ... blood stained with blood, the corpse fell in front of you ...
(?:?) A knock on the door awakened you. You let the people outside wait a minute, and then patted your face hard to restore some consciousness and rationality.
(?:?) You open the door to see [Lady Hong] and ask her to enter the house.She asked you to the kitchen?Did you answer, and then what time do you ask her now?She said that it was probably "Two Makes" (23:30), and you knew that he had lost his mind for a while.[Lady Hong] After leaving, you closed the door.
(00:40) You basically restore the normal state. When you open the window and want to breathe, see a dead person outside the window!You look at it, as if the blood of the past dyed them again, you are very panic, and even want to escape immediately.
(01:00) You open the door of the room and see that no one in the corridor, quietly walk out of the mansion, come outside the window of your room, and see a bloody "white scarf" hanging on the body through the moonlight.You can't let the corpse be found outside your window anyway-you can see your biological son tomorrow, you can't be suspected-not to mention that you are still running away.
(01:10) You drag the body with a "white scarf" and want to throw it into the north woods of the village. You just pulled it to the bottom of the window (the window of the master bedroom on the first floor), and listened to a woman's voice and asked, "YesYou? "You quickly left the body and ran back to the house.
(01:20) You go back to the room and drink "sedative", restore the calmness with the medicinal strength, sleep peacefully ...

In the dream, you see your son close at hand, but you can't touch him. His eyes are strange and terrible ... Pointing at you, "Killing the murderer" ...Escape from the detention ...
