Character story
You are the second son of [Yao Changshou], and your mother [Zhang Yadi] is the dowry maid of your father's eldest wife [Madam Xu]. You are always comparing [Madam Xu] and her son [Yao Mengren] (your eldest brother). Lower class. The only person who can treat you equally is [Minyue Sister] who lives in the mansion together. She has a good relationship with your cousin [Zhang Decai] (your mother's nephew, who lives with you). She also teaches you and your eldest brother "Enlightenment" Thought".
Your only friend is named [Yu Junhong]. He met you when he came to "Baili Village" more than ten years ago (1900). (1903) After your mother fell from the second-floor balcony and died, your father sent you to study in the capital and stayed at his house. Three years ago (1911), I received a letter from home saying that my eldest brother had passed away. At that time, [Madam Xu] was already dead, and my father remarried [Lady Hong] as his stepmother. After you returned home, you stayed in "Baili Village" and only exchanged letters with your friends.
My father did not send his eldest brother’s body to the ancestral grave, but was buried deep in the woods in the north of the village (outsiders didn’t know the way in): there was a piece of yellow land with a two-story mansion in the middle. The eldest brother’s grave was to the east of the mansion. , built with bricks and stones, with the inscription "Tomb of Meng Ren, the unworthy son of the Yao family" engraved on it. The front door of the mansion was firmly locked with a "big lock" (the lock was decorated with French blue paintings, and the keyhole was made with a special flat mouth). My father didn't have the key, so he tore down the back wall of the mansion and arranged for his eldest brother's new wife [ Chen Junmeng] lived in the house to observe mourning, and sent someone to deliver meals every day - this is the first time you saw [Chen Junmeng], she took off her red dress and put on mourning clothes, and changed from a bride to a widow.
You often go to the woods and see [Chen Junmeng] from a distance. One day, you saw her standing on the balcony and letting a white dove fly. Her beautiful face was pale and touching - your heart was deeply touched by this scene.
About half a month ago, a naughty boy ran into the woods at night. You took someone to find him. He kept talking nonsense about seeing a "ghost" - there was no living thing where the "ghost" walked, and even the poisonous snakes were scared away. ······You see this place is not far from the foreign hotel. I was worried about [Chen Junmeng], so I asked someone to send the naughty boy out and went to find her.
You see [Chen Junmeng] standing in front of the mansion, holding an "empty wooden cage". The moonlight shines on her body, as if she has been coated with a halo. At this time, you realize that something is wrong - it is July now, and the temperature in the woods is It is much lower than outside, and the buzzing of insects around you has disappeared... Under the silent night, only you and her are left breathing. You mustered up the courage to walk over and use the topic of naughty boys to talk to [Chen Junmeng] for the first time - [Chen Junmeng] said that she encountered a naughty boy surrounded by poisonous snakes. When she went to rescue him, the poisonous snakes fled one after another, and she also Don't know why.
You immediately think of your good friend [Yu Junhong], who is well-informed and very enthusiastic. You promise [Chen Junmeng] that this matter will be investigated soon. You see [Chen Junmeng] smile and feel the urge to hug her, but the white clothes on her body remind you that she is your widowed sister-in-law. !
You write a letter to [Yu Junhong] and ask him to come to Suzhou to help you investigate "strange things" - you have a very bold idea at this time: This is already the third year that [Chen Junmeng] has kept filial piety for her eldest brother. Waiting for her filial piety At the end of the period, you can remarry her for your eldest brother!
Your father fell ill the next day, [Lady Hong] asked a female Western doctor [Doctor Fang] to treat him, but you felt it was not effective - your father would sometimes sit motionless on the bed, unable to even speak clearly.
(August 1st) A [mysterious man] wearing a "black jazz hat", covering his face with a "white scarf", and a pair of "sunglasses" comes to your house to look for you. When he sees you, he takes off his disguise - It’s your eldest brother [Yao Mengren]!
The eldest brother takes you to the guest room on the second floor and tells you that his current identity is Xu Boqing, a soldier of the Republic of China. He was ordered to come to "Baili Village" for business and will only stay at home for a few days. He warns you not to reveal his identity to anyone. If asked, just say that he is the "creditor" of the [Yao] family.
You told him that [Chen Junmeng] was keeping filial piety for him, and he said to himself: "I have already sent her home, why did she come back again..." You were about to ask him about what happened three years ago, and he I asked your father if he was sick. After you nodded, your eldest brother said: "Curse - this is a curse! I warned him long ago..."
Yesterday (August 2) afternoon
The eldest brother asked you to send a "letter" to the "Linchi Inn" in Suzhou, and [Yu Junhong] happened to live there. After you handed the "letter" to the inn, you picked up your friend and took a carriage back to "Baili Village".
You were chatting about stories from all over the world on the road, from the late Qing Dynasty to the Republic of China. You were chatting happily, and [Yu Junhong] suddenly asked about that "weird thing" - after the eldest brother came back, the "weird things" around [Chen Junmeng] took turns. Without you coming to ask, you can only explain to your friend: "When I wrote to Brother Yu, I really wanted to ask Brother Yu to come and find out what the 'strange thing' was - but I didn't expect that it turned out to be a 'curse'..." "..." You used "curse" to describe your eldest brother's return, and then said: "I have an unkind request right now, and Brother Yu must agree to it!" "
You mentioned your family situation to [Yu Junhong]. You wanted to ask him to play the role of a "doctor" who had returned from studying abroad. In the name of seeing a doctor, you asked him to ask your sick father something in private, away from others. 【Yu Junhong】What is curiosity? You clenched your fists and said, "How did my elder brother Yao Mengren die?"
After the carriage arrives at "Baili Village", you take your friend to the guest room on the second floor (you prepare a guest room for him with a low fence between the terrace). After placing your luggage, go down to the living room on the first floor to meet [Lady Hong] - she is talking to [Doctor Fang] Talk, [Doctor Fang] said goodbye when he saw you guys coming in - you took the opportunity to introduce your friend (Physician Yu) to [Lady Hong] as planned.
While [Lady Hong] was talking to [Yu Junhong], [Chen Junmeng]'s maid [Chen Anqiao] came in with a [Short-haired Woman] carrying luggage. She said she was looking for [Xu Boqing]. You immediately take her to the eldest brother's room on the second floor - when you go upstairs, you exchange names and find out that her name is [Yun Ling].
[Xu Boqing] was very happy to see [Yun Ling] and asked you to go out - you didn't know what they were talking about in the room. You only heard the laughter of the elder brother, and then the elder brother asked you to send [Yun Ling] to the guest room on the second floor to settle down.
The guest room key is in the master bedroom on the first floor. When you took the key, you saw your father lying on the bed, his chest rising and falling. You quickly got the medicine (only you and Lady Hong and Doctor Fang had the key to the locked medicine cabinet, and you saw the door open). The floor-to-ceiling thick curtains hung on the floor-to-ceiling windows in the room, and one of them was pulled open - you didn't care, found the key, and sent [Yun Ling] to the guest room closest to the balcony on the second floor. Then you ask the elder brother who this woman is? The eldest brother said: "She will be Xu Boqing's wife." You immediately ask him what to do with [Chen Jungmeng] who is a filial piety?
The eldest brother said lightly: "I didn't expect her to come back - it's already the Republic of China, why should she keep filial piety... Just wait until her filial piety period expires and tell her to marry someone else." You were surprised and happy after hearing this. , but seeing my eldest brother looking for a new love, I felt a little uneasy...
You wanted to see [Chen Junmeng], but you didn't know whether you should tell the truth. You hesitated several times, and finally walked out of the woods and saw billowing black smoke and firelight rising from the depths of the woods. A [man with disheveled hair] was at the edge of the woods, grabbing [Yu Junhong] who was injured and unconscious. You ran over to support your friend and explained your identity. At this time, you saw [Yun Ling] supporting the unconscious [Chen Junmeng].
[The man with messy hair] calls himself [Uncle Gui], knows some medical skills, and wants to help. You didn't have time to think too much, so you asked [Yun Ling] to help [Chen Junmeng] into the old room on the first floor of the mansion (the eldest brother's former bedroom), while you helped [Yu Junhong] to the guest room on the second floor. Soon [Uncle Gui] came up to help [Yu Junhong] treat the wound on his arm. [Yu Junhong] woke up at this time. You brought him water and kept thanking [Uncle Gui]. [Uncle Gui] gave [Yu Junhong] After feeding him water mixed with medicine (you think it was to help his friend recover), [Yu Junhong] fell into a deep sleep.
[Uncle Gui] will tell you about [Chen Junmeng]'s situation - her eyes have been treated with medicine because toxins affect her vision. She should not open her eyes for the next few days. She will be fine after changing the medicine a few times. After [Uncle Gui] left, you saw that [Yu Junhong] was breathing unsteadily, so you stayed with him until he was breathing normally, then you felt relieved.
It's getting dark now, so you go to visit [Chen Junmeng] - she closes her eyes, you greet her gently, and she asks you to take her to the master bedroom to meet your father.
You held her hand and came to the master bedroom, where you saw [Lady Hong] and [Uncle Gui]. My father was so excited that he struggled out of bed and said, "My Meng Ren is back...I saw him..."
[Lady Hong] The lamp in his hand fell to the ground, and flames burst out. His father tore open his "diary" (you have never read the contents) and threw it into the fire. [Uncle Gui] stamped it out like a ghost. . No one spoke, only [Yao Changshou] looked at the "burnt paper" and said: "I found it...you can't take it away..." [Chen Junmeng] cried, [Uncle Gui] asked you to send her back and remember to change the medicine again tonight. You helped her back to the room to change the medicine. Seeing the tears in the corners of her eyes, she suddenly felt resentment towards her elder brother, but thinking that as long as the elder brother leaves with [Yun Ling], you You can wait for your beloved to officially marry her after her filial piety period, and be happy again - [Chen Junmeng] When you asked what your father said, you replied that your father was seriously ill and started talking nonsense.
Yesterday (August 2) evening
In addition to looking at the watch or clock, the time in the game is an estimate, and there will be an error of about 10 minutes.
(21:50) You went to the kitchen to find food for [Yu Junhong] who had not eaten dinner. When you saw a plate of "Taihu Whitebait" (this is Lady Hong's specialty), you brought it out on a tray.
(22:00) You walk up to the second floor, and your eldest brother opens the door from his guest room. He holds the "black jazz hat", "white scarf" and "sunglasses" used for disguise in his hands. You know that he does whatever he wants and is a little worried. The eldest brother asked you to go to the rooftop (you put down the fish after you went up), he followed up, threw the "three disguises" off the rooftop in front of you, and then said: "I quit! What kind of soldier of the Republic of China? It's meaningless to check for any crime. Yun Ling can't see my intentions, so why should I be regarded as Xu Boqing!" You asked him immediately if he was coming back?
"Of course! Let Xu Boqing go to hell!" the eldest brother said viciously, "I want to go back to Yao Mengren, and then punish the woman who claims to be filial and honest to me, but is still having an affair with the outside world." "..." You couldn't help but retort: ​​"How could you say that about her!" "Stop talking nonsense, you were born by a concubine, and you still dare to ask about my affairs! I said it and there is evidence!" He kicked him down. You, beat again and again - just like when you were a child.
You are no longer the [Yao Zhongyi] you were before. When you resisted him, you grabbed a "pistol" from his waist. He laughed when he saw it: "If you have the ability, shoot here!" He pointed to his forehead and helped you open the safety of the gun. Then he leaned on the edge of the rooftop and laughed at you: "Yao Zhongyi! You and your mother They are all servants and bastards of my Yao family..." The eldest brother's words make you not believe that he is a soldier of the Republic of China in the new era. There is no way he can bring about an era of equality!
(22:30) You want to warn the elder brother, raise the muzzle of the gun and pull the trigger. Unexpectedly, the recoil of the gun is so strong that it almost knocks you down. The elder brother leans back, lets out a scream, and approaches from the middle of the rooftop. It fell outside and fell down. Your hands were still shaking, and you used all your strength to throw the "pistol" off the rooftop and then fell to the ground. The sound of gunfire made you unable to hear for a moment. You blocked your ears, and the voice of your elder brother calling your name kept echoing in your mind.
(23:00) Your hearing finally recovered. You looked down from the rooftop: your eldest brother’s body was on the west terrace of the second floor. Blood poured out of your chest and dyed the terrace red. You felt very calm at this time. , only the fatigue after losing force.
(23:10) You saw [Yu Junhong] coming out of the room at the stairs to the rooftop. Remembering that you had to go find him and bring him food, you returned to the rooftop to pick up the "Taihu Silverbait".
(23:20) You knocked on [Yu Junhong]’s door and asked, “Brother Yu, are you back?” There was no response from the room, so you had to put the “Taihu Silverbait” outside his door and go downstairs.
(23:30) You go back to your room and hear someone asking "What time is it now?" The voice is very close. You open the door a crack and see [Lady Hong] blushing and coming out of [Uncle Gui]'s room. .
(23:50) You didn’t know if your friend was back, so you went upstairs again and saw your elder brother’s “Black Jazz Hat” on the ground at the door of the storage room on the second floor. You picked it up and ran back to your room, feeling panicked.
(00:10) You really want to see [Chen Junmeng] at this time, so you go to the old house on the first floor and see your sweetheart sitting on the bed with an extra "accessory" around his neck. You asked her how her eyes were, but she didn't answer. Instead, she suddenly asked you: "Is there anyone else in the room?" You looked around the room and told her no. She shook her head and said, "I met your eldest brother..." This sentence was like a bolt from the blue, and you hurriedly said, "Impossible! He is dead - I saw it with my own eyes!" Then you turned and ran out.
(00:20) You hide in your room, unable to sleep. You remember that your father’s medicine contains mood-stabilizing medicine, so you go to the master bedroom to get it. 【Lady Hong】is not in the room at this time, her father is sleeping soundly. You realize there's no more medicine in the cupboard. You searched the bedroom and found nothing.
(00:50) You returned to your room disappointedly. The moment you closed the door, you saw [Lady Hong] leading a man into the master bedroom. You encountered too many unexpected situations tonight, and finally felt tired and fell asleep.
This morning (August 3)
You kept having nightmares and managed to stay up until dawn. You knock on [Yu Junhong]’s door. After he opens the door, you take him to the living room - you guess that your eldest brother’s body was seen - [Yun Ling] said that there was no carriage leaving the village last night, so the real murderer must still be hiding. it's here······
