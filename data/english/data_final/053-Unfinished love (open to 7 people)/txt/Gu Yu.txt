You and [Lin Xi] Blue Plum Bamboo Horse, the relationship is very good, [Lin Xi] has not been good since she was a child, but you still stayed with her. On her 18th birthday, you gave her a violin -shaped pendant.She is a belief in your love.When you are 20 years old, you enter the family company to help your father take care of business.Soon you discovered the secret of the company. Under your repeated inquiries, your father gave you a report. You know that there is a patient named [qin siqin] and a patient named [Zheng Xinmei] 15 years ago.After cardiac surgery, infection was caused by using your company's medical equipment.But this matter was pressed by Renhe Hospital Dean [Lin Weiren] and your father [Gu Ming].The family members of the deceased suffered from no evidence and could only give up prosecution.You can't forgive your father's approach, so you secretly investigated the victims of the matter of the year to compensate them. Soon after you found the daughter of [Zheng Xinmei], [Chen jingwen], and sent her a sum of money anonymous every month for herShe finished college.You originally thought that no one would know about this, but a year and a half ago, [Chen jingwen] appeared in front of you.She became a reporter. After many investigations, she finally found the person who finished her college, which is you.Since that day, you have a little fan, but only [Lin Xi] in your heart is full of your second person.Soon after, the condition of [Lin XI] was worsened. [Lin Weiren] arranged her to go to the United States to cure the disease. You naturalIt's right.In desperation, you can only stay in China and wait for news.Although there are only half a year of separation, it is like you.A year ago, [Lin Xi] returned to China, you couldn't wait to see her, but I was disappointed that [Lin Xi] lost his previous memory.Don't remember who you are, let alone your love.You tell her that you are her boyfriend, but she has no impression at all, but you are not discouraged. You believe that one day she will think of it, and one day you can continue the forefront.
However, things are not as good as you think. Soon [Lin Xi] I broke up with you, and came together with [Su Yang].You can't help but feel like a knife.Drunk you seem to see [Lin Xi] and walk towards you, and you rush up and hug "LIN XI" to let her not leave you.The next day, you found that you and [Chen jingwen] were lying on the same bed, and you immediately realized what happened.So you decide to be responsible, and you have become your girlfriend in this way.
Although you have a new girlfriend, you have never put down [Lin Xi].Life passes day by day.You feel the difference between [Lin Xi], you feel that this [Lin Xi] is not your [Lin Xi]. Your [Lin Xi] will not smoke or like spicy food.You feel [Su yang] brings to your favorite person.
One day a month ago [Chen Jingwen] came to the company to find you to tell you, but you are going to have a meeting and let her wait for you in your office.The meeting temporarily decided to delay the end, so you came out and prepared to tell your girlfriend. I just walked to the door of the office. You see [Chen jingwen] and watching your computer and files.What you want to find, originally you think she is just a simple little girl, but now you finally understand that she is close to you.You can't help but think of her mother's death 15 years ago.You can't help but feel guilty and turn around.After the meeting, you are going to confess to her, but she tells you that she has been pregnant for two months.This news allows you to swallow it again.You don't know what to do.[Chen jingwen] I also noticed your strangeness, and I no longer speak.A few days later, you received the invitation letter of [Su Yang] [Lin XI]. You feel that the five flavors are mixed and you feel that you have no chance.
However, even more terrible things happened, and your father was killed in his office.You feel very panicked. You think of what happened 15 years ago for the first time. Your reaction was accurately captured by your sister. She repeatedly asked if you had any hiding her, but you couldn't say it.Nothing can be said.You are afraid, you are afraid of [Chen jingwen].If it is really, the result will make people unacceptable.After all, [Chen jingwen] is pregnant, the child is yours.So you don't intend to tell anyone about the secret 15 years ago.
Today, you and [Chen jingwen] come to the Lin's Manor to participate in the engagement party at five o'clock.You stay in the room separately. Your heart is very chaotic. The favorite person is married to others. Those who have their own children may be those who kill their father.You don't know what to do, walk and walk back and forth on the second floor.I don't know how long, you return to your room, you are surprised to find that [Chen jingwen] is in your room, you close the door, she walked over and hugged you, telling you that she knew the truth of the year,But she has fallen in love with you, and has your child, so she has no way to get revenge, she just wants to be with you well.You don’t know what she is talking about is true or not, and I don’t know if she uses you anymore, but whether out of guilt or the child in her belly, you can only choose to protect herShe is well -thoughtful, this is your fate.At 8:30, [Chen jingwen] left your room.You asked the servant to give you a bottle of red wine and a bucket of ice alone in the room until 9 o'clock party. You found that the [qin Siqin] survey report that should have been in your company's safe 15 years ago appeared in the room.In the middle, but it was gone.
At the party, you are stunning by [Lin Xi] with a black off -back evening dress. You have never seen such [Lin Xi], and you find that she is so sexy and beautiful, you can't help but watch.You walked to [Lin Xi] to express your praise, and at the same time saw [Su Yang] Tie Qing's face.
9:10 You are in a very heavy mood. I ran to the bathroom and washed the face and returned to the party.
At about ten o'clock, when [Su yang] and [Lin XI] were about to cut the engagement cake, the lights of the party venue suddenly extinguished.The power supply recovered, and the housekeeper Shen Cheng ran in panic and told everyone [Lin Xi] 's father died in the study.
