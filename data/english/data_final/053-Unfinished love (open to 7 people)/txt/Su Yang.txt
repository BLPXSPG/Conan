When you heard that the daughter of [Dean Lin] returned to China to recuperate, he took the initiative to be her attending doctor. You planned to kill [Lin Xi], but when you saw her, you felt your [Lin LinTong] Still alive, her heart is still beating, and you feel the shadow of [Lin Tong] from [Lin Xi], you are soft -hearted, you put all your feelings for [Lin Tong] to [Lin Xi] On the body, [Gu Qing] to visit [Lin Xi] almost every day, but you know, in fact, she is to look at you.You gradually discovered that [Lin Xi] is more and more like [Lin Tong], eating spicy, smoking, including feelings for you, you think [Lin Tong] is back, you have pursued herBreak up with [Gu Yu], you are together.After that, [Guqing] did not come again.
You suddenly think of the "cell memory" of foreign medical scientists. One idea appears in your mind. You want [Lin Tong] to resurrect on [Lin XI].So you start studying cell memory and prepare to publish academic papers.You took her all the places where you and [Lin Tong] have beautiful memories, eat [Lin Tong] what you like to eat, do what you like to do.But fate joked again with you. One month ago, on the evening of June 20, you followed [Lin Xi] to the Gu's medical device office building. You waited for her downstairs for a long time. You found [Lin Xi]When you come out with blood, you run up and find that [Gu Ming] was died through the heart by a knife, you know that it was done by [Lin XI], [Lin Xi] with the memory of [Lin Tong], soA revenge for my mother and killed [Gu Ming], you are afraid that you will lose "[Lin Tong]" again, so you mess up the scene as a robbers and murder, stole the monitoring records of the building and leave the scene.
You have been together with [Lin Xi] for almost a year. You decided to engage in engagement, but at this moment [Lin Xi] tells you that his father did not agree with your engagement.You are afraid that your plan will be discovered, and you do n’t expect what you expected. [Lin Weiren] took out the evidence you and [Lin Tong] that year, you have to leave you to leave [Lin Xi], otherwise you will tell the truthYou rejected him.You tell him that no one can separate you from "[Lin Tong]".
You and [Lin Xi] came to the manor one day in advance to prepare for the party. You gave [Lin Xi] a black off -back evening dress, which was worn by [Lin Tong].The night before you found [Lin Weiren], a person secretly came to the manor, and you know he was here to destroy your engagement party.You secretly observed that you find that only the housekeeper [Shen Cheng] knows that [Lin Weiren] is here, so you decide to kill him before the party.You did not tell [Shen Cheng] your plan, because after you and [Lin XI], he always thought you were a thin person, and put you with the Lin family into the hatred of hatred.Can never explain to him.
On the day of the party, all invited guests arrived at the manor at 6 pm. At 6:30, you did not pay attention to the coffee of [Lin Weiren] with the housekeeper. At 8 o'clock, you do n’t pay attention to everyone.When I arrived at the study, looking at the sleeping [Lin Weiren], you inserted it into his heart without hesitation.After killing [Lin Weiren], you are going to return to your room. You met [Lin Yang] at the entrance of the stairs. You are panicked, but you pretend to be calm.He left.Back in the room, you took a bath quickly and came to the party scene without dressed.
At 9 o'clock, the party started on time, [Lin Xi] appeared in the black backless evening dress you gave her, and you saw it. You seemed to see your [Lin Tong].You said softly in the ear of [Lin Xi] that you are beautiful and sexy today.You noticed that [Gu Yu] watched [Lin Xi] like you, you can see God. You know his feelings for [Lin Xi], look at [Gu Yu] to [Lin Xi], and be around [LinXi] The hand of the waist is tight, but you are not afraid, because you have his handle in your hand, [Lin Tong] The survey report for the cause of the death of the mother.
At about 10 o'clock, when you and [Lin Xi] were about to cut the engagement cake, the lights at the party venue suddenly died.Restore, the housekeeper [shen Cheng] runs in panic and tells you that the father of [Lin Xi] died in the study, and you put down the wine glass in your hand and hurried to the study with everyone.
Seeing the corpse of [Lin Weiren], you pretend to be sad, but you are puzzled, why do you suddenly stop power?What are the people in these people present?You can't help but be nervous, you are afraid that you will be revealed with [Lin Xi].You can only find a scapegoat.(If [lin xi] accident or identification, you may lose your mind to kill your doubt with your pistol.)
