your story
Your full name is [Zhou Chitong]. You are originally from Hefei, Anhui. You were born in the 12th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty (1886). Your parents died early. Your eldest brother [Zhou Mengdang] is 8 years older than you. had friendship with your ancestors, so your eldest brother took you to "Cuizhuang" and was arranged to live in the "front yard".
When you were 8 years old (1893), your eldest brother didn't want to be laughed at for living a free life, so he practiced martial arts hard and worked as a nurse in "Cuizhuang". He sent you to a village school to study - you didn't like going to school and just wanted to make money as soon as possible. Help your elder brother share your worries.
The following year (1894), [Cui Shouheng] sent his elder brother and others to Wuhu to bring Taitai (Wang Shi)'s sister [Xi Yan] to "Cui Zhuang" and arranged for her to live in the "North Courtyard" (Xi Yan Fang) and gave her a little maid named [Bao Gan].
A year later (1895), [Bao Gan] angered [Xi Yan] and escaped from "Cuizhuang" for fear of being beaten. The eldest brother was ordered to look for him and went outside to inquire every day.
After some time, the eldest brother finally found [Bao Gan] and brought her back safely. He first punished her for escaping according to the rules of "Cuizhuang" and locked her up in the "South Courtyard" - look at [Bao Gan]'s appearance He was dirty, thin, and wearing old clothes, and he couldn't bear it. He also saw his elder brother locking a wooden board on the well in the "South Courtyard" with an iron chain to seal the well mouth, so he secretly brought water to [Bao Gan] without telling his elder brother. .
[Bao Gan] was released after he promised not to escape again, and he still returned to the "North Courtyard" to serve [Xi Yan].
The eldest brother was already old enough to marry, but he had no money saved. For the sake of ancestral friendship, [Cui Shouheng] took the initiative to marry Taitai's maid to the eldest brother - you now have a sister-in-law, and you are very happy.
The sister-in-law's maiden name is "Yu". She married her eldest brother in the "front yard" of "Cuizhuang", and later brought her younger brother [Su Nian] (Yu Su Nian) to live together - the eldest brother and sister-in-law lived in the back room. You live in an outhouse with Su Nian, who is 8 years younger than you, and he calls you "Brother Tuesday."
The next year (1896), my sister-in-law was already several months pregnant. My eldest brother did not want his family to live with others, so he decided to go out and join the army. He said that he wanted to find a career for his child in the future, and asked you to take care of the family for him. He patted his chest and agreed.
After your eldest brother leaves, you will stop studying - [Cui Shouheng] Let your family continue to live in the original house. Taitai misses the old friendship and sometimes helps his sister-in-law.
When your sister-in-law was about to give birth, you panicked, and [Su Nian] would only cry aside. Thanks to Taitai, who called for a midwife, your sister-in-law gave birth to a boy smoothly. Mother and child were safe, and you had a nephew from then on.
The eldest brother was not in "Cuizhuang" at the time, you had not read many books, and your sister-in-law was even illiterate, so you asked Taitai, who came from a scholarly family, to name the boy [Lianyi] (Zhou Lianyi).
Taitai was also pregnant at that time. After her confinement, her sister-in-law moved back to the "North Courtyard" with [Lianyi] in her arms and lived in the "West House". While raising the child, she took care of Taitai and earned some household income at the same time - you took [Su Nian] still lived in the "front yard" and took care of him for his sister-in-law. At that time, you were also afraid of being laughed at and eating for free, so you went to the "kitchen" to help the cooks light the fire and earn a few copper coins, but you were worried about [Su Nian] staying in the house. If something happens, take him with you... When [Su Nian] grows up in a few years and can help you carry firewood, you won't have to look at him at all times.
[Bao Gan] once thanked you for bringing her water, and sometimes came to chat with you - you had never talked to a girl like this before, but you were embarrassed to see her look fair.
Later you and [Bao Gan] got to know each other and found out that she knew her sister-in-law and called her "Sister Bao Liu".
In early winter, Taitai gave birth to a daughter, named [Yannan] (Cui Yannan).
In the following years, the eldest brother returned to "Cuizhuang" to visit relatives every year. Unfortunately, he was never promoted. He stayed in "Cuizhuang" for only a few days and left in a hurry... [Su Nian] was young at the time and would sometimes run away. I went to the "North Courtyard" where the female relatives lived to find my sister-in-law. I didn't have to avoid the distinction between men and women with [Lianyi] and [Yannan], and they played together since childhood.
When you were 15 years old (1900), your sister-in-law disappeared. Taitai asked you to take [Lianyi] out of the "North Courtyard" where the female relatives lived, and live with you and [Su Nian] - [Lianyi] who could not find her mother. He often cried and cried, but [Su Nian] kept coaxing him.
You remember that the last time you saw your sister-in-law was one night when you were chatting with [Bao Gan] in the yard and saw your sister-in-law carrying [Lianyi] to the house where you and [Su Nian] lived - waiting for you and [Bao Gan] When they separated and returned to their residence, the sister-in-law had already gone back with the child in her arms - you asked [Su Nian] what her sister-in-law was doing, and he said that her sister came to you with [Lianyi] in her arms and went back without seeing you.
Not long after, the eldest brother came back to visit relatives. He didn't see his sister-in-law, so he went out to drink with a sullen face. He came back drunk. When you helped him into the back room to rest, you finally heard the eldest brother tell you the difficulty. He joined the army to fight against the bandits and had already made meritorious service. But because he couldn't spend 200 taels of silver on it, he never got an official position...
You were anxious for your elder brother, thought about it over and over, and finally remembered that when Taitai asked you to take [Lianyi] away from the "main house", he saw that you were pitiful, so he opened a locked box under the bed, took out a few taels of silver and gave it to you, saying that it was The wages your sister-in-law paid for embroidering things for her daughter... You saw the key and put it in the "main house"!
After your eldest brother left "Cuizhuang", you decided to steal 200 taels of silver - of course you couldn't tell [Bao Gan] this idea. When chatting with her, you only said that your eldest brother came back to visit relatives and didn't see his wife, so he went to the river outside the village. While drinking, he came back drunk and said that when he became a general, he would pick up his relatives and leave "Cuizhuang"...
After winter, Taitai's sister [Xi Yan] married [Cui Shouheng] as a concubine, and the sisters shared the same husband.
You sometimes watch [Su Nian], [Lianyi] and [Yannan] playing in the "front yard" together, and hear [Yannan] say that she saw her father going to the "Xi Yan Room" to find her aunt, but still not returning to the "Master's Room" at night , she wanted to go to her aunt to call her father back - her mother refused to let her go, and sighed again and again, and asked the maid [Bao Gan] to hold her, and they went to spend the night in the "South Courtyard" together... This reminds you of You can steal money when there is no one in the "house master's room".
Soon came the next year (1901). Through a period of observation, you knew that after Taitai took [Bao Gan] [Yannan] out of the "North Courtyard", he would have someone lock the door from the inside and sneak into the "North Courtyard" in advance. "North Courtyard", hiding in the innermost part. When Taitai and the others went out at night, they sneaked into the unoccupied "house master's room", found the key in the house, opened the box, stole a full 200 taels of silver, then locked the box and put the key back. at.
The foundation in the "main house" is about 40 centimeters high. Viewed from the outside through the small window on the north side, it is more than 2 meters above the ground. You were only in your teens at this time and were small and light, so you brought in furniture for climbing. After stepping on it, get out of the small window, first fall on the courtyard wall, then grab the top of the wall, and go down to the lakeside on the north side of "Cuizhuang" - if you don't dare to leave the money with you, just go around "Cuizhuang" and run Go to the "cemetery", bury all the money behind a barren tomb, write down the five words on the broken tombstone of the barren tomb, then run back to "Cuizhuang" and copy them on paper.
Later, Taitai asked [Bao Gan] to leave [Xi Yan], and [Cui Shouheng] planned to buy a new maid for [Xi Yan]. When she went to the "main house" to get money, she discovered that the locked box under the bed was missing. money.
[Cui Shouheng] first thought it was a domestic thief, so he went to the "front yard" to search everyone's residence, but did not find the money, so he suspected Taitai had stolen it...Taitai was so angry that he fell ill that night.
[Bao Gan] took care of Taitai and gave her medicine every day, but Taitai coughed up blood and died before she could make it through the winter. Her body was black and blue... [Cui Shouheng] suspected that the doctor had used the wrong medicine and sued her. I went to the Yamen and asked the doctor to pay a large sum of funeral expenses.
[Bao Gan] I told you these things while chatting with you, but you lied to her, saying that your eldest brother has not returned to "Cuizhuang" this year - in fact, your eldest brother comes back to visit relatives every autumn, and you are in "Cuizhuang" in advance this year Stop the eldest brother outside, show him the words you copied, and ask him to dig them out in the "cemetery" and use them to sort out.
After the New Year (1902), [Xi Yan] was righted and became the new Taitai.
At the end of summer, the eldest brother finally became a "bangdao" (a kind of deputy military attache) and returned to "Cuizhuang" to pick you up and [Lianyi]. [Su Nian] knelt down to the eldest brother and begged you to take him with you - -You and [Lianyi] have been living together with [Su Nian] these years, sharing the joys and sorrows, and helped him beg his elder brother, and the elder brother agreed to take [Su Nian] away together.
Before you left, you went to [Bao Gan] to say goodbye, and your heart was full of reluctance - [Bao Gan] asked you to promise to keep in touch, and you kept nodding... After leaving "Cuizhuang", you guys first Follow your eldest brother to live in the military camp in Lianghuai and watch him lead the troops to drill every day... Later [Su Nian] and [Lianyi] were sent to study, and you found a job in a foreign bank, running errands for the British. I put on a suit and taught myself a few words in foreign language.
In the first year of the Republic of China (1912), men cut off their braids and men and women were no longer strictly prohibited from meeting each other. The eldest brother followed him and changed from the Qing army to the new army. His immediate boss was changed to the "Henan and Anhui Border Envoy" (Ni Sichong) who was deeply trusted by the president.
Last year (1913), [Su Nian] went to Hefei City to apply for a job as a teacher in a new school, and [Lianyi] was still with his elder brother - you know that the elder brother wanted to find a good job for [Lianyi] so that he could have a future.
This year (1914), warlords from all over the country were proud of their troops. After the immediate boss of the eldest brother's army was promoted to "General Anwu", he led the "Anwu Army" to dominate Anhui. The Governor's Mansion built in Bengbu was called the "General's Administration", also known as "General's Mansion" - You heard that the "General's Mansion" will be electrified and installed with lights, and you think you can take advantage of the opportunity to make money - the electric lights at this time are called "incandescent lamps", which were invented only a few decades ago, and they can light up when electricity is applied.
You think that [Su Nian] must know these things, so you go to him for a drink on the Mid-Autumn Festival (October 4th) and express your thoughts. [Su Nian] tells you that the filament in the light bulb has changed from the original one. The "carbon wire" was changed to "tungsten wire". The latest model is the "spiral tungsten wire" invented by the Americans last year (1913)... [Su Nian] said while proposing a cooperation to make a lot of money. The idea--rather than connecting with foreigners, it is better to open your own factory--use your eldest brother's relationship in the army to open up the joints of the "General's Mansion", earn a sum of money for the government's purchase of electric lights, and then sell them throughout the province and the country. ·····
You said that you also know that this method is good, but where can you find the capital to open a factory?
[Su Nian] After discussing with you, I thought of [Cui Shouheng] - [Su Nian] said that his eldest brother has been transferred to Hefei at this time. As long as he has a military background to come forward and explain the benefits and dividends to [Cui Shouheng], The combination of kindness and power will definitely attract his investment!
After dawn, you reached an agreement with [Su Nian], and then split into two groups - [Su Nian] went to prepare samples and equipment, and you went to convince the elder brother - you found the elder brother that day, and after explaining the plan to him, the elder brother also felt that It's feasible. Let you go to "Cui Village" to visit [Cui Shouheng] first and get a feel for him, and then he will come back to talk.
On October 12th, you brought a prepared "incandescent light bulb" and came to "Cuizhuang" for a visit. You met with [Cui Shouheng] in the "reception room" and talked about the plan - you used inducements and used them at the same time. The eldest brother is now working under a big warlord, and he is implicitly threatening... [Cui Shouheng] said that he would think about it for a few days, and please stay here first.
You were arranged to live in the "guest room" in the "front yard". After you moved in, you thought of [Bao Gan] and wondered how she was. Unexpectedly, she came to you in the "guest room" and chatted with you about the past - this At that time, [Bao Gan] had become [Cui Shouheng]'s concubine and changed her name to [Tian Chou]... You thought that you didn't contact her as promised, and you felt guilty, and you were also emotional about her being forcibly taken. Explain that you have not forgotten her all these years - if you want [Tian Chou] to take a high look at you, tell her that you want [Cui Shouheng] to invest in building a factory for you, and that big brother will come to talk to [Cui Shouheng] in a few days. 】After the interview and other matters are completed, you will be the factory director!
[Tian Chou] finally showed a smile - you felt happy, and just about to talk about his plan, [Tian Chou] looked out the window and stood up, saying that he would go back to the "main room" to serve the master... You looked at [ Tian Chou] left, very reluctant to leave. That night I dreamed that she came to see you, and you woke up just as you were about to pull her to bed. You could only sigh...
In the next two days, [Tian Chou] came to the "guest room" to see you every day, but could only stay with you for a moment. You looked forward to spending the night with [Tian Chou], but had to watch her turn around again. Leaving·······
On the afternoon of October 15th, [Cui Shouheng] came to the "guest room" to find you, saying that he received an invitation from your elder brother yesterday and was going to Huafang for an appointment... You immediately accompany [Cui Shouheng] by car and go out along the road. After bypassing "Cuizhuang" and coming to the lake, I saw a three-story painting boat parked next to the big pier.
The eldest brother, wearing casual clothes, got off the boat and welcomed [Cui Shouheng] into the "banquet hall" on the first floor. After you chatted with him for a while, the eldest brother asked you to see how [Su Nian] was preparing - you Walking out of the cabin, I saw a hand-cranked "generator" installed on the deck in front of the boat. Two long wires were pulled out from the first deck and connected to the trees on the west side of the big pier, connected to several glass products. (Small bulbs).
You see [Su Nian] and [Lianyi] under the tree, so you get off the boat and ask them what they are doing - before [Su Nian] answers, you see [Tian Chou] and two women coming over - you immediately He took [Su Nian] and [Lianyi] to greet him.

Act 2:
The story after the pleasantries
[Tian Chou] and [Yannan] both accepted your invitation, and [Xi Yan] also nodded in agreement, and followed you onto the boat, carefully bypassing the generators, wires and tools installed in front of the boat, and walked into the "banquet hall" , I met [Cui Shouheng] with the big brother who was having a drink inside - the big brother stood up to welcome you, you said that we would watch "Incandescent" together after dark, and then talked about the past in "Cui Zhuang"... You intentionally looked at [Tian Chou] while you were speaking and saw her lowering her head.
After all, there are differences between men and women, [Xi Yan] then took [Tian Chou] and [Yannan] to the "small banquet hall" on the second floor for a drink, while the men stayed in the "banquet hall" - in order to persuade [Cui Shouheng] to invest, you and [Lianyi] raised their glasses to him one after another, and [Su Nian] also joined you, talking about the prospects of the factory, and adding wine to [Cui Shouheng] - under your turns to persuade him to drink, [Cui Shouheng] was already very drunk. Drink a lot more.
When it got dark, everyone walked out of the cabin and stood on the south deck of the first floor of the boat. They were blown by the cool breeze and sobered up a little - [Su Nian] went to turn the hand-cranked "generator" and the current was quickly connected to the small electric light. On the sky, they emit a fleeting light - they are not dazzling, just like the rotten grass is a firefly, and it is difficult to compete with the bright moon...
You felt disappointed and looked at [Tian Chou] again, seeing that she was shaken by the light and her steps were unsteady. Fortunately, [Yannan] on the side helped her in time - [Tian Chou] said that she felt uncomfortable due to the wind, [Yannan] and helped her back to the cabin - you heard [Yannan] say to accompany [Tian Chou] upstairs to rest for a while, and also wanted to accompany [Tian Chou], and saw [Xi Yan] walking into the cabin, so you followed them in.
At this time, [Su Nian] stops the joystick, and you follow [Xi Yan] up to the second floor and enter the "Small Banquet Hall". Watch [Yannan] help [Tian Chou] sit down, and [Tian Chou] lies on his back. On the table, I heard a drunken man’s voice calling [Yannan] below.
[Xi Yan] pulled [Yannan] outside the "small banquet hall". At this time, only you and [Tian Chou] were inside - [Tian Chou] whispered to you with misty eyes: "I drank too much, I'm afraid now I can't leave... Come and see me off later..." You were overjoyed when you heard this, feeling that your wish would be fulfilled immediately, so you nodded your head and almost laughed out loud.
[Xi Yan] walked into the "small banquet hall" at this time. You were afraid that she would become suspicious, so you went out and went downstairs. [Yannan] followed you back to the first floor. You saw [Cui Shouheng] staggering, her face red, her mouth It smelled of alcohol.
[Yannan] wanted to send [Cui Shouheng] home, and [Lianyi] came to help. The eldest brother asked you to take the lantern and see off the guests for him. [Su Nian] was still checking the machine and seemed dissatisfied with the effect.
You held the lantern in one hand, and supported [Cui Shouheng] with [Lianyi] in the other hand. [Yannan] followed you around the generators, wires and tools installed in front of the painting boat. You didn't see the carriage, so you could only walk back to "Cui Shouheng" along the road. Village"... [Yannan] returned to "Cuizhuang" and went to find the servant to put the lit charcoal into the charcoal basin in the "house master's room" - [Lianyi] supported [Cui Shouheng] and entered the "North Courtyard" "When you returned to the room, [Cui Shouheng] shouted for water, so you went to the "kitchen" and poured a bowl of water. Then you brought it into the "main room" and saw that the charcoal basin in the house had been lit with charcoal. [Lianyi] helped [Cui Shouheng] sit on the bed and took the water bowl from your hand.
[Yannan] You wanted to open the small window in the "main room" but couldn't reach it, so you moved a chair from the bedside, stepped on it and opened half of the small window. Seeing the dark night outside, you found that the other half of the small window was blocked. Crucified - you are afraid that when you come down [Cui Shouheng] wakes up and sees the chair under the small window, you will remember the time when you lost the money, and quickly move the chair back to its original place. [Cui Shouheng] shouted for water again. [Yannan] took the bowl of water handed by [Lianyi] and turned around to hand it to [Cui Shouheng], watching him drink it all in one breath.
[Cui Shouheng] was still awake after drinking water, and regardless of [Tian Chou] not coming back, he put down the bowl and said he wanted to rest, so you all exited the "main room" and listened to [Cui Shouheng] lock the door from the inside-- You know [Cui Shouheng] drank too much. He probably won’t wake up until dawn after going to bed. Tonight is the chance!
[Yannan] Seeing that it’s already getting late, I’ll leave you and [Lianyi] to stay in the “guest room”.
[Yannan] After you have settled in, go to the "South Courtyard". You were worried about going back to find [Tian Chou], but were afraid of being noticed by others including [Lianyi], so you asked [Lianyi] to go to the "guest room" and chatted with the housekeeper "Uncle Fu" for a few words before saying you wanted to go back. Go to the boat, then carry the lantern and leave "Cuizhuang".
You held the lantern and carefully walked around "Cui Zhuang" along the road. When you crossed the bridge, you vaguely saw candlelight moving towards the "Big Pier" - the lantern in your hand suddenly dimmed, and you quickly took a look. Inside the lantern, I found that the candles were almost burned out, so I ran back to "Cuizhuang", knocked on the door, returned to the "guest room", removed the candle holder in the room and replaced it, left "Cuizhuang" again, and walked to the big pier. , then I remembered that I didn’t see [Lianyi] in the “guest room” just now.
You didn't think too much at the moment and boarded the boat. After carefully bypassing the pile of things installed in front of the boat, you heard [Tian Chou] ask from inside the cabin: "Taitai, I'm going back, will you come with me?" ?" Then I heard another woman's voice reply: "I still have something to talk about, so you can go back first."
You had already walked to the cabin door and saw [Tian Chou] agreeing outside the door of the candle-lit "banquet hall": "Okay, Taitai." Then she turned around and walked out of the cabin, meeting you face to face. superior.
You and [Tian Chou] were planning to have a private meeting. Naturally, you were afraid of being discovered by people in the cabin, so you didn't dare to say anything. You carefully walked around the pile of things installed in front of the boat and got off the boat together.
You held the lantern, and [Tian Chou] took you to the foot of the "Barren Mountain" and hid in a cave behind the pavilion... You didn't expect there was such a good place, so you put down the lantern and hugged [ Tian Chou], before he could take the next step, he saw [Tian Chou] crying...
You immediately panicked. Seeing [Tian Chou] keep crying, you kept comforting her. By the time she stopped crying, it was already October 16th... You looked at [Tian Chou]'s crying face, I seem to see the dirty little maid [Bao Gan] again, remembering the time when she came to chat with you as a child, and her grievances in "Cuizhuang"... At this time, the autumn wind has cooled, [ Tian Chou] huddled in your arms, closed her eyes, and soon fell asleep - you felt more and more pitiful for Tian Chou, so you hugged her, closed your eyes to rest, and made up your mind to let Tian Chou
【Tian Chou】Get rid of 【Cui Shouheng】 and be your woman!
At dawn, [Tian Chou] woke up in your arms, and you told her that you would take her to ask your elder brother for help... At this time, you just wanted to keep [Tian Chou] by your side and did not want her to come back again. "Cui Zhuang".
You then took [Tian Chou] back to the "big pier", walked around the pile of things installed in front of the boat, walked into the first-floor cabin, and saw [Xi Yan] coming down from the second floor, and [Yannan] coming down from the "first room" "Coming out, [Lianyi] pulled [Su Nian] in the corridor of the cabin, pointed at the "banquet hall" and shouted: "My father was killed!" You can't believe it - the eldest brother has martial arts, and usually carries crossbows and arrows with him. How could he be killed so easily with a pistol?

Act 3:
next story
At noon, you all saw your eldest brother's body, and you stayed on the boat together, keeping everything on the boat as it was. Just when you were about to discuss and come to a conclusion, "Uncle Fu", the steward of "Cuizhuang", ran into the cabin.
"Uncle Fu" was panting and said that he came to see Taitai, his aunt and the young lady... When "Uncle Fu" saw them, he first greeted them and saluted, and then talked about how he saw [Lianyi] at dawn. 】I came out of "North Courtyard" to say goodbye to him. I took the lantern I borrowed from him last night and hurriedly left "Cuizhuang". It seemed that I had already said hello to the master - "Uncle Fu" remembered that the master was drunk last night. I'm back, I don't dare to disturb you right away...
After daybreak, "Uncle Fu" still didn't see the master get up and come out, so he went to knock on the door outside the "main house", but no one answered.
"Uncle Fu" said that he tried to push the door open at that time and found that the door of the "main house" was bolted from the inside. Knowing that the master had the habit of locking the door before going to bed, he knocked hard several times and called to the master, "Uncle Fu" There was still no movement inside - "Uncle Fu" was now panicked. He couldn't find Taitai, his aunt and the young lady at home. He heard that they were all invited to the "Hua Fang" yesterday, and only the young lady accompanied the master back at night. But he is not in "Cuizhuang" at this time.
"Uncle Fu" didn't dare to make his own decision, so he could only come here and go back to Taitai, his aunt and the young lady to make up his mind.
After [Xi Yan] listened, he took [Tian Chou] and [Yannan] home. You and [Su Nian] and [Lianyi] also accompanied them, and followed "Uncle Fu" back to "Cuizhuang" and walked in "North Courtyard" and tried knocking on the door of "Master's Room" a few more times, but there was still no response.
[Yannan] got anxious and asked "Uncle Fu" to quickly find someone to break the door open - you and [Su Nian] and [Lianyi] didn't wait for "Uncle Fu" to call the servants, and worked together to break the door of the "main house" Open - As the latch was broken, the door finally opened. You walked in and saw [Cui Shouheng] lying on his side on the bed. His face remained red as if he was drunk, but he was motionless. You walked forward. I tried it with my hands and found that [Cui Shouheng] was not breathing. I hurriedly told everyone that [Cui Shouheng] was dead and her body was cold...
[Yannan] burst into tears immediately, and [Tian Chou] held her in his arms--[Xi Yan] was so frightened that her face turned pale... You looked around and saw that the small window at this time was still open from inside the house. It was open, the brazier was overturned against the wall, and there was an empty bowl on the table next to the bed.
