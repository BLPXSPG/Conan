your story
Your full name is [Cui Yannan]. You were born in the 22nd year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty (1896). Your mother [Wang Xi Rong]’s natal family is in Wuhu, Anhui. Your ancestors were successful in raising people, but unfortunately, their descendants failed in many attempts. Later, the family fell into decline. Marry the eldest daughter (your mother) to the owner of "Cui Village" [Cui Shouheng] (your father).
You heard your mother say that before you were born, your sister [Xi Yan] (Wang Xi Yan) was the only relative left in your family - your mother asked your father to send someone to bring your sister [Xi Yan] (your aunt) from her hometown in Wuhu. "Cui Zhuang" lived in the "North Courtyard" (Xi Yanfang) from then on. His father gave his aunt a personal maid named [Bao Gan].
The year after my aunt came to "Cuizhuang" (1895), my father decided to marry his mother's maid [Yu Shi] to [Zhou Mengdang] who lived in the "front yard". The newlyweds took [Zhou Mengdang] with them. [Zhou Chitong], the younger brother of [Yu Shi], and [Su Nian] (Yu Su Nian), the younger brother of [Yu Shi], live together.
In the year you were born (1896), [Zhou Mengdang] left the already pregnant [Yu Shi], went out to join the army, and left the family children in the care of his younger brother [Zhou Chitong]... After that [Yu Shi]  gave birth to a boy. Because he was illiterate, he went to ask his mother to name her son. He called him [Lianyi] (Zhou Lianyi) - your mother was already pregnant with you at that time. [Yu Shi] held you in her arms after confinement. [Lianyi] moved back to the "North Courtyard" and lived in the "West House", raising her children, serving her mother, and earning some household income at the same time.
In early winter, you were born and named [Yannan] (Cui Yannan).
When you were 4 years old (1899), your mother wanted to find an in-law for your aunt, and she told your father about it - you could already remember things at that time, and every time you heard adults talk about past events, you could remember a lot (such as Those things before you were born were just what the adults told you), and [Lianyi] grew up in the "North Courtyard".
Although [Su Nian] is [Lianyi]'s uncle, he is only 2 years older than him. He often comes to the "North Courtyard" to see his sister [Yu Shi]. You three children don't have to avoid the distinction between men and women. You have played together since childhood - -[Yu Shi] has very skillful hands and embroidered a "broker bag" for you. Mother put some things in it and joked that when you get married in the future, remember to take it out and look at it... ·
A year later (1900), one night, you saw [Yu Shi] walking out of the "North Courtyard", and you never saw her again... [Lianyi] came to the "Master's Room" to look for his mother, She was left to eat by her mother. A few days later, her mother asked [Zhou Chitong] to take [Lianyi] out of the "North Courtyard" where the female relatives lived, and to live in the "Front Courtyard".
After the Mid-Autumn Festival, your mother felt unwell, so she borrowed her aunt's maid [Bao Gan] from the "house master's room" to help her take care of you - [Bao Gan] is 10 years older than you, has learned how to read from your mother, and is very kind to you... ···Later, you heard from the adults that my aunt was dying in her room, and you didn’t know what happened.
At the end of autumn, as soon as my mother recovered from her illness, she went to live with her aunt... When winter came, you saw your mother helping your aunt change into red clothes, and then she was sent in and was in the room with her father. Go to bed... You didn't know at that time that your aunt was taken as a concubine by your father. You only knew that she and her mother sometimes quarreled, and then she went back to live in the original house.
[Su Nian] and [Lianyi] are both looking forward to [Yu Shi] coming back. [Su Nian] often comes to the "North Courtyard" to ask if his sister is back. Seeing that you are scared because of the quarrel between your aunt and your mother, he pulls you. Go out to find [Lianyi] and play together in the "front yard" - You tell [Su Nian] and [Lianyi] that you saw your father going to the "Xi Yan Room" to find his aunt and still not returning to the "Master's Room" at night, so you You want to go to your aunt to call your father back - your mother won't let you go. She sighs again and again and asks the maid [Bao Gan] to hold you and spend the night together in the "South Courtyard".
The first time you saw the dry well in the "South Courtyard", someone had already locked a wooden board on it with an iron chain, sealing the mouth of the well - you were always crying for your father at that time, [Bao Gan] tight Hug you tightly, mother is crying beside you...
When you were 6 years old (1901), because you liked [Bao Gan], you begged your mother to keep her - your mother listened to your words and asked for [Bao Gan]. The father planned to buy a new maid for his aunt, but when he returned to the "main house" to get some money, he discovered that there was money missing from the locked box under the bed, and he couldn't help but be furious.
Do you remember that the box is always locked and the key is usually placed in the "main room" - when your mother takes [Bao Gan] and you to the "South Courtyard" at night, she will always call the maid "He" after walking out of the "North Courtyard" Sao" locked the door of the "North Courtyard" from the inside and never took the key to the locked box out.
The father first thought it was a thief, so he went to the "front yard" to search everyone's residence, but did not find the money, so he suspected that the mother had stolen it... The mother was so angry that she fell ill that night. The doctor diagnosed It was a cold - my father heard my mother cough and was worried about infecting him, so he asked my mother to move to the "West House" - you know my father has always been afraid of getting cold and sick. Every year after the Mid-Autumn Festival, he would put an iron charcoal basin in the house. Put in burning charcoal to keep warm at night, and open a small window for ventilation to avoid getting "charcoal poison".
My father later had half of the small window in the "main house" nailed shut. He told his mother that even a ten-year-old child would not be able to get in from the outside - to see if he would lose any more money... ··
You didn't want to leave your mother, so [Bao Gan] took you to live in the "West House", taking care of your mother at the same time, boiling medicine every day... Even so, your mother didn't make it through the winter.
On the day when my mother passed away, I heard [Bao Gan] mention that her aunt had asked her to make "red bean fermented rice" in the "kitchen", so she said she wanted to drink it too... [Bao Gan] went out to get "red bean fermented rice" for her mother. When you were young, your mother would tell you that she and her aunt liked to eat this kind of snack when they were children, and then she would say that she was sorry for her aunt...
[Bao Gan] brought back a bowl of "red bean fermented rice". Not long after my mother drank it, her condition suddenly worsened and she began to cough up blood. She said that if she died, she would leave all the jewelry to her aunt... After that Before the doctor could come, my mother died and her body turned black and blue.
After you lost your mother, you cried very sadly. Thanks to [Bao Gan] who has always been by your side... Your father suspected that the doctor had used the wrong medicine and sued the doctor to the government office, causing the doctor to pay a large sum of funeral expenses. .
After the New Year (1902), my aunt was straightened up and became a new Taitai. She still stayed in her original residence (Xi Yanfang) with her new maid (Bao Gui) bought for her by her father.
At the end of summer, [Lianyi]'s father [Zhou Mengdang] returned to "Cuizhuang" and picked up his family.
You can't forget the day [Su Nian] and [Lianyi] left "Cuizhuang". It was raining outside and you had lost your mother. You didn't want to lose your friends around you anymore, so you ran out, crying and saying that you didn't want them to leave. ·····【Lianyi】must follow his father, and I can only promise you that he will definitely come back in the future!
Three years later (1904), her father adopted [Bao Gan] as his aunt and asked her to move from the "West House" to the "main house" - you were reluctant to leave [Bao Gan] and ran to your father to make a noise, and he was not allowed to take it. Go to [Bao Gan]. Your father was very angry. Not only did he scold you for losing your mother, he also asked you to move out of the "North Courtyard" and live in the "South Courtyard", where you would be taken care of by a maid (Bao Yang).
[Bao Gan] changed her name to [Tian Chou] after she became an aunt, and she still often comes to the "South Courtyard" to visit you, and only goes back at night - besides [Tian Chou], her aunt will also come to the "South Courtyard" to teach you how to read and accompany you. overnight.
In the first year of the Republic of China (1912), men cut off their braids and men and women were no longer strictly prohibited from meeting each other.
Last year (1913), you told [Tian Chou] that you wanted to go to school, and she went to your father to intercede for you.
Only then did your father agree to let you live and study in a new-style school in Hefei City.
After that, you finally left "Cuizhuang" and only came back during festivals or holidays. The maid who originally took care of you moved to the "West House" in the "North Courtyard" and continued to serve the female family members.
This year (1914), the school hired a new "Mr. Yu" (teacher) to teach "Western Studies". You thought "Mr. Yu" looked familiar, so you followed him quietly. Later, you saw "Mr. Yu" and a young man in the room. Talk together.
The young man noticed you and came over to call your name. You nodded in surprise and felt that the other person seemed familiar. The young man was very excited. He first told you that he was [Lianyi], and then said that he had just returned to Hefei and was waiting to settle down. Okay, I'll visit your home.
You were naturally very happy to suddenly meet your childhood friend again. You had a lot to say, but before you could chat with [Lianyi] for a few words, you were interrupted by the sound of the school bell, and you had to go back to the classroom... You were at school afterwards I have never seen [Lianyi] again.
When you went to "Mr. Yu" to ask about [Lianyi], you recognized him as [Su Nian] - you thought they would never appear again, but you didn't expect to see them again. You were so excited that you almost cried, and you hurriedly He said that he always remembered [Su Nian] and [Lianyi], and never forgot that you played together when you were young - that was your happiest time... When [Su Nian] reminisced with you, you thought of them leaving again. That rainy day, you were sad because you didn't say goodbye to [Su Nian]... Now you no longer regret it.
You went to see [Su Nian] every day from then on, and gradually developed a relationship with him that was beyond your childhood playmates. You knew that [Su Nian] was a teacher, but you fell in love with him, and your relationship quickly developed into a passionate love. He was noticed by the school, so he and [Su Nian] have always treated each other as teacher and student. They waited until late at night to meet outside the school and have no worries under the stars.
In September, the school suddenly suspended classes, and the students had to go home. As a teacher, [Su Nian] stayed in the dormitory of the school, waiting for new news. You and he separated again, and after returning to "Cuizhuang", you stayed at home.
On the Mid-Autumn Festival (October 4th), after celebrating the festival with your whole family, you returned to the "South Courtyard" alone carrying a lantern. Just as a gust of autumn wind blew, your heart trembled, and you felt even more sad when you thought of not knowing when we would see [Su Nian] again. .
On October 12, someone came to visit and met his father in the "guest room". After chatting for a long time, he was left by his father to live in the "guest room" in the "front yard".
On October 14th, you saw [Lianyi] coming to "Cuizhuang" to deliver invitations. You wanted to wait for him to meet his father before coming out to find him, but you didn't expect that he left right after delivering the invitations.
On the afternoon of October 15, my father and his guests took a car to go to an appointment.
You missed school life, and you missed [Su Nian] even more. You were extremely bored staying in the house, so you went to the "Master's Room" to find [Tian Chou], and took her with you to chat with your aunt. During the period, you heard the maid talking about the pier. A big boat came and saw the master going up there. [Tian Chou] wanted to watch the fun - you know that my aunt and [Tian Chou] have been staying in "Cui Zhuang" almost all their lives, and they have long thought that they should go out. , so I begged my aunt, who is Taitai, to take you out.
My aunt nodded in agreement. After dressing up, the three of you went out together. You walked around "Cui Village" along the road and walked towards the lake. You saw a three-story boat parked next to the big pier. Two long wires were pulled out from the first deck. , has been connected to the tree on the west side of the big pier, and is connected to several glass products (small light bulbs).
You have seen these things in school, recognized them as light bulbs, and remembered that you heard in class that this kind of light bulb is called "incandescent lamp". It was invented by Westerners only a few decades ago. The filament inside was originally made from Change "charcoal wire" to "tungsten wire" and it will light up when you turn on electricity... You were just thinking about what [Su Nian] said in class, and you saw him standing under the tree!
You were so excited that you almost screamed, and then you saw [Su Nian] and [Lianyi] and a man in a suit beside him - they came over after seeing you.

Act 2:
The story after the pleasantries
You and [Tian Chou] both accepted [Zhou Chitong]'s invitation, and your aunt nodded in agreement. You followed [Zhou Chitong] and the others onto the boat, carefully bypassing the generators, wires and tools installed in front of the boat, and walked into " "Banquet Hall", and met [Zhou Mengdang] with his father who was having a drink inside - [Zhou Mengdang] was wearing casual clothes and stood up to welcome him. [Zhou Chitong] said that they would watch "Incandescent" together after dark, and then talked about the time when they were there The past of "Cui Zhuang"... You and [Su Nian] were afraid of being noticed, so you deliberately avoided looking at each other.
After all, there are differences between men and women, so your aunt then took you and [Tian Chou] to the "small banquet hall" on the second floor for a drink, while the men stayed in the "banquet hall" - after you and [Su Nian] said goodbye for a while, okay? It's easy to meet again, but we didn't have the chance to say a few more words. I couldn't help feeling melancholy and drank a few more glasses of old wine.
When it got dark, everyone walked out of the cabin and stood on the south deck of the first floor of the boat. They were blown by the cool breeze and sobered up a little - [Su Nian] went to turn the hand-cranked "generator" and the current was quickly connected to the small electric light. On the sky, they emit a fleeting light - they are not dazzling, just like the rotten grass is a firefly, and it is difficult to compete with the bright moon...
[Tian Chou] was shaken by the light and her steps were unsteady, but you helped her in time. [Tian Chou] said that she felt uncomfortable due to the wind. You didn’t know when her father would come home. She also thought that [Tian Chou] had had a few too many drinks just now, so she said that she would accompany her upstairs to rest for a while, and then help [Tian Chou] walk. Enter the cabin.
At this time, [Su Nian] stopped the joystick, and her aunt and [Zhou Chitong] also walked up to the second floor... You supported [Tian Chou] into the "small banquet hall", and [Tian Chou] sat down Just lie on the table, and then you hear a drunken man's voice calling you from below, like a father.
Your aunt pulls you out of the "small banquet hall" and suddenly asks you if you have anyone you like right now?
You were shocked and immediately shook your head. Your aunt sighed and asked you to go down and see what happened to your father. She stayed with [Tian Chou] until she sobered up.
[Zhou Chitong] After coming out of the "small banquet hall", you followed him downstairs. You saw your father stumbling, his face flushed, and the smell of alcohol in his mouth. You were afraid that something would happen to him if he continued to drink, so you had to send him back. Home - [Lianyi] came over to help, [Zhou Mengdang] asked [Zhou Chitong] to take the lantern and see off the guests for him, [Su Nian] was checking the machine and had no time to say goodbye.
[Zhou Chitong] is holding a lantern in one hand and supporting his father with [Lianyi] in the other. You follow them around the generators, wires and tools installed in front of the painting boat. You don't see the carriage, so you can only walk back to "Cuizhuang" along the road. .
You were afraid that your father, who drank too much, would catch cold and fall ill like your mother, so when you returned to "Cuizhuang", you asked the servants to put the lit charcoal into the charcoal basin in the "main house" - [Lianyi] then helped your father to enter. "North Courtyard", [Zhou Chitong] went to the "kitchen" of the "front yard".
You watched the servants arrange the charcoal basin in the "main room", [Lianyi] helped his father into the room and sat on the bed, [Zhou Chitong] came in with a bowl of water, and [Lianyi] took it.
You wanted to open the small window of the "main room", but you couldn't reach it. [Zhou Chitong] moved a chair from the bedside, stepped on it and opened half of the small window, and saw that it was dark outside.
[Zhou Chitong] moved the chair back to its original place after coming down. His father shouted for a drink of water. You took the bowl of water handed over by [Lianyi] and turned around to hand it to your father, watching him drink it all in one breath.
My father was still awake after drinking water, and he didn't care that Tian Chou didn't come back. After putting down the bowl, he said he wanted to rest, so you all exited the "main room" and listened to your father lock the door from the inside.
Have you ever heard [Tian Chou] say that since his father lost his money, he has been extra careful. Not only does he carry the key to the lock box with him, he will also lock the door from the "main room" before going to bed. When [Tian Chou] comes back You can't even get in late... You didn't expect that your father would not forget this habit even after drinking too much. He probably wouldn't wake up until dawn after he went to bed.
You see it's already getting late, so we leave [Zhou Chitong] and [Lianyi] to stay in the "guest room".
After you settled the two of you, you walked towards the "South Courtyard". At the door of the hospital, you suddenly remembered what your aunt had just said. You were worried that your father would force you to get married, so you planned to go find your aunt while your father was drunk and ask questions - because your aunt didn't tell you When we come back together, you can only find a lantern, put a candle in it and light it, and then go back to the boat to find her.
You hold the lantern, go out and walk around "Cui Zhuang", walk back to the "Big Pier", board the boat, and carefully walk around the pile of things installed in front of the boat. Before you enter the cabin, you see [ Su Nian] came out of the cabin and met you on the deck.
You were pleasantly surprised. [Su Nian] came over and whispered in your ear that his brother-in-law should still be in the "banquet hall", so don't disturb him... You know that [Su Nian] is afraid that your affairs will be discovered by others. Not wanting to hide his feelings, he whispered to him: You miss him... [Su Nian] then blew out the candles in your lantern and pulled you into the cabin - you see " The "Banquet Hall" was lit by candlelight, and I could vaguely hear a conversation inside. I was afraid of being discovered when I walked past, so I quietly walked into "Room A" opposite with [Su Nian].
You came here in a hurry at night, without any clothes, and your body was a little shaky. After entering the house, [Su Nian] immediately untied the waistcoat outside the gown and hugged you - you and [Su Nian] snuggled together, feeling the warmth on his body. Warm, his face became hotter than his body.
After your hands and feet became warmer, you heard a woman outside ask: "Taitai, I'm going back, will you come with me?" A voice like [Tian Chou] was heard, and then you heard someone reply: "I'm still There are things we need to talk about, so please go back first." A voice sounded like that of an aunt.
"Okay, Taitai." After a voice like [Tian Chou] said, you heard someone walking out of the cabin.
Only then did you realize that you were originally here to find your aunt, but you were reluctant to leave. You hugged [Su Nian] hard, unwilling to let him go - [Su Nian] stroked your head and whispered something, as if he was asking you What happened after leaving school and returning home... When you answered, you heard footsteps again in the corridor of the cabin heading to the west. After that, you relaxed, your body became warm, your eyelids became heavier and heavier, and you fell asleep before you knew it. .
You heard the sound of running in the corridor outside "Room A". When you opened your eyes, you realized that it was already dawn and it was already October 16th - you were wearing the vest that [Su Nian] had taken off, still You can feel the warmth... You rubbed your eyes and turned your head to look, but you didn't see [Su Nian]. You stood up hurriedly, put your vest on the table, and heard someone's footsteps coming downstairs, so you walked out. "Room A", I saw [Zhou Chitong] and [Tian Chou] coming in from outside the cabin, and my aunt came down from the second floor. [Lianyi] pulled [Su Nian] on the corridor of the cabin, pointed to the "banquet hall" and shouted: " My father was killed!”

Act 3:
next story
At noon, you all saw the body of [Zhou Mengdang] and stayed on the boat together, keeping everything on the boat as it was. Just when you were about to discuss and come to a conclusion, "Uncle Fu", the steward of "Cuizhuang", ran into the cabin.
"Uncle Fu" was panting and said that he came to see Taitai, his aunt and the young lady... When "Uncle Fu" saw you, he first asked you to salute, and then talked about how he saw [Lianyi] at dawn. 】I came out of "North Courtyard" to say goodbye to him. I took the lantern I borrowed from him last night and hurriedly left "Cuizhuang". It seemed that I had already said hello to the master - "Uncle Fu" remembered that the master was drunk last night. I'm back, I don't dare to disturb you right away...
After daybreak, "Uncle Fu" still didn't see the master get up and come out, so he went to knock on the door outside the "main house", but no one answered.
"Uncle Fu" said that he tried to push the door open at that time and found that the door of the "main house" was bolted from the inside. Knowing that the master had the habit of locking the door before going to bed, he knocked hard several times and called to the master, "Uncle Fu" There was still no movement inside - "Uncle Fu" was now panicked. He couldn't find Taitai, his aunt and the young lady at home. He heard that they were all invited to the "Hua Fang" yesterday, and only the young lady accompanied the master back at night. But he is not in "Cuizhuang" at this time.
meaning.
"Uncle Fu" didn't dare to make his own decisions, so he could only come here and find Taitai, his aunt and the young lady to go back and take the initiative.
After my aunt heard this, she took you and [Tian Chou] home. [Zhou Chitong] and [Su Nian] and [Lianyi] also accompanied you. They followed "Uncle Fu" back to "Cuizhuang" and walked into " North Courtyard", and tried knocking on the door of the "main house" several times, but there was still no response.
You are anxious, ask "Uncle Fu" to find someone to open the door quickly - [Zhou Chitong] and [Su Nian] and [Lianyi] do not wait for "Uncle Fu" to call the servants, and work together to open the door of the "main house" Bumping open - As the latch was broken, the door finally opened. You walked in and saw your father lying on his side on the bed. His face remained red as if he was drunk, but he remained motionless. [Zhou Chitong] stepped forward. I went to try it with my hands and hurriedly told everyone that [Cui Shouheng] was dead and his body was cold...
When you saw your father dead, you cried immediately. [Tian Chou] held you in his arms again just like when Taitai died... At this time, the small window was still open from inside the house, and the brazier Overturned against the wall, there was an empty bowl on the table next to the bed.
