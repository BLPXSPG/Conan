your story
Your full name is [Wang Xi Yan]. You are originally from Wuhu, Anhui. You were born in the eighth year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty (1882). Your ancestors were successful in raising people, but unfortunately, their descendants failed many times. Later, the family fell into decline, and your father (Wang Shunming) will raise you. The 6-year-old eldest daughter [Xi Rong] (your sister) married [Cui Shouheng] as his wife.
In the second year after your sister got married (1894), your parents passed away one after another. You were helpless and could only write letters to your sister. You were taken to "Cuizhuang" - one of the people who came to pick you up was named [Zhou Mengdang] escorted you all the way from Wuhu to "Cuizhuang" - you had never left home before, and you felt uneasy after going out. Along the way, you kept talking to [Zhou Mengdang] to relieve your uneasiness.
After arriving at "Cui Zhuang", you were arranged to live in the "North Courtyard" (Xi Yanfang). Your brother-in-law (Cui Shouheng) gave you a maid named [Bao Gan] who is 4 years younger than you and asked her to serve you personally. .
At that time, apart from your sister, you only knew Zhou Mengdang in "Cuizhuang". You often went to the "front yard" to talk to him, and learned that his ancestors had a relationship with your brother-in-law's family. Later, like you, both parents died. , so he took his young brother [Zhou Chitong] to live with others - [Zhou Mengdang] didn't want to live an idle life, so he relied on his martial arts skills to help his brother-in-law... At that time, you were just in love. Although you fell in love with [Zhou Mengdang], But she could only meet him without telling anyone, not daring to let her sister and brother-in-law know.
When you were 14 years old (1895), you and [Zhou Mengdang] fell in love with each other, but you didn’t know when they would get married. Seeing that the Mid-Autumn Festival had passed, the cool breeze was picking up, and my heart was full of melancholy - you hadn’t seen me for several days in a row. When you go to [Zhou Mengdang], you can't help but feel depressed. The face wash water brought by [Bao Gan] scalds you, so you take the opportunity to scold her and feel sulky. Unexpectedly, this little girl suddenly starts crying, which makes you even more upset. You raise your hand and Want to hit her.
[Bao Gan] was afraid of being beaten, so he ran out. You chased him into the yard and met his sister's maid [Bao Liu]. You were stopped by her, but he didn't succeed. Feeling angry, you attacked [Bao Liu] who was hiding behind him. Bao Gan said he would beat her to death when she came back--unexpectedly, [Bao Gan] did not come back that night. You went to the "Master's Room" and told the story about [Bao Gan]'s disappearance. Your brother-in-law assured you that he would send someone to find [Bao Gan].
After some time, [Zhou Mengdang] brought [Bao Gan] to you. You see that [Bao Gan] has become dirty, thin, and wearing old clothes. You guessed that she must have suffered a lot outside, so she didn’t come back. scolded her.
The brother-in-law then made the decision to marry [Bao Liu] to [Zhou Mengdang] - by the time you learned about this, [Zhou Mengdang] had already married [Bao Liu] in "Cuizhuang".
You didn't want to hear the noise of the wedding coming from the "front yard", so you could only cover your ears and hide in your room to cry. Fortunately, [Bao Gan] ran out to watch the excitement and didn't see your sad and embarrassed look.
After [Bao Liu] married [Zhou Mengdang], she followed her husband to live in the "front yard". You heard the maid "He Sao" say that [Bao Liu] also brought his younger brother to live in "Cuizhuang"... ···
The following year (1896), [Zhou Mengdang] left the pregnant [Bao Liu] and went out to join the army, leaving the family child in the care of his younger brother [Zhou Chitong]... After that, [Bao Liu] gave birth to a boy , because she was illiterate, she asked her sister to name her son [Lianyi] (Zhou Lianyi) - her sister was also pregnant at that time, and [Bao Liu] moved back to "Lianyi" after confinement. "North Courtyard", living in the "West House", raising children, serving your sister, and earning some household income at the same time - you take [Bao Gan] to the "housekeeper's house" to see your sister every day, and ask [Bao Liu] privately if he has [Zhou Mengdang] news, [Bao Liu] just shook his head.
In early winter, my sister gave birth to a daughter, named [Yannan] (Cui Yannan) - you didn’t realize it at that time, sister
The way your husband looks at you has changed...
In the following years, [Zhou Mengdang] returned to "Cuizhuang" to visit relatives every year. You met with him without telling [Bao Liu]. After the separation, you missed him even more. Therefore, you began to hate [Bao Liu] and would deliberately find fault with her. Machine scolded her.
When you were 18 years old (1899), your sister wanted you to get married, but you could not forget [Zhou Mengdang] and did not agree.
A year later (1900), [Bao Liu] disappeared, and his sister asked [Zhou Chitong] to take [Lianyi] out of the "North Courtyard" where the female relatives lived, and live with him and [Bao Liu]'s younger brother.
[Zhou Mengdang] When you came back to visit relatives and didn’t see your wife, you went to the river outside the village to drink. After you heard about it, you ran out to find him and stayed with him until the evening. Hearing his personal promise, he would come to pick you up when he became a general. Leave "Cuizhuang" with his relatives - if he hasn't found [Bao Liu] by then, he will marry you!
After the Mid-Autumn Festival, my sister felt unwell and lent [Bao Gan] to the "main house" to help her take care of [Yannan] - At that time, you only hoped that [Zhou Mengdang] would fulfill his promise, and you were worried about [Bao Liu] coming back - you I even had nightmares about it, dreaming that when [Zhou Mengdang] married you, [Bao Liu] suddenly appeared...
At the end of autumn, your brother-in-law said that he would take you as his concubine. You were shocked. You first thought of running away, but you had nowhere to go, so you had no choice but to commit suicide. You asked the maid "He Sao" to buy a pack of "poisonous rat poison" and drank it. Some, and soon you fell to the ground with abdominal pain, and you were unconscious from the pain... "He Sao" asked someone to bring you salt water to induce vomiting, and your brother-in-law invited a doctor to save you - you barely opened your eyes Eye, I saw my brother-in-law picking up the package of "poisonous rat poison"...
My sister was afraid that you would commit suicide again, so she came here and watched you until winter came, when you were put into red clothes by your sister and sent to the bridal chamber. From then on, you became a husband with her... You hated your sister because of this, and you quarreled when they met. If you say you don't want to live with her, [Cui Shouheng] agrees that you stay in the original house (Xi Yan room) and he comes to spend the night with you.
When you were 20 years old (1901), your sister left [Bao Gan] with her, and [Cui Shouheng] planned to buy you a new maid. When you went to the "main house" to get money, you discovered that the locked box under the bed was missing. money.
[Cui Shouheng] First of all, I thought it was a house thief. I went to the "front yard" and searched everyone's residence. I didn't find the money, so I suspected that my sister had stolen it... My sister was so angry that she fell ill that night. --You still didn't forgive your sister at that time, and you were too angry not to visit her. You only knew that she was diagnosed by the doctor as suffering from cold, and you moved to the "West House" with [Bao Gan] [Yannan], and died before she could survive the winter.
Do you still remember the day your sister died? You wanted to eat the "red bean fermented rice" from your hometown. You told [Cui Shouheng] that after he had it cooked in the "kitchen", he personally brought it to you and gave you a bowl, but [Bao Gan] 】I want to leave with a bowl... Not long after you finished eating the "red bean fermented rice", you heard that your sister's condition suddenly deteriorated. Before the doctor could come, she coughed up blood and died. Before she died, she told her that The jewelry is all left to you.
After you lost your sister, you regretted not staying with her when she needed her most. Later, when you saw your sister's body with a black face, you felt even more shocked... [Cui Shouheng] I suspected that the doctor had used the wrong medicine, He filed a lawsuit with the government office and the hospital paid a large sum of money for the funeral expenses.
After the New Year (1902), [Cui Shouheng] straightened you up and became the new Taitai. You felt sorry for your sister even more and were unwilling to move to the "main house" with the new maid that [Cui Shouheng] bought for you. (Bao Gui), staying at his residence, he would dream about his sister from time to time, and would apologize to her in his dream.
What makes you even more miserable is that not long after, [Zhou Mengdang] became a general as promised, but was unable to marry you... At the end of summer, [Zhou Mengdang] wanted to take away his younger brother and son, and even [Bao Liu] My younger brother did not meet you - when you learned all this, you could only hide and cry again, helplessly accepting your fate.
Three years later (1904), [Cui Shouheng] adopted [Bao Gan] as her aunt and asked her to move from the "West House" to the "main house". From then on, [Bao Gan] changed her name to [Tian Chou] - [Yannan] No. Wanting [Cui Shouheng] to take a concubine, she even ran to her father to make a fuss - [Cui Shouheng] was very angry, scolded [Yannan] who had lost her mother, and asked her to move out of the "North Courtyard" and into the "South Courtyard" She was moved to live in the house and was taken care of by a maid (Bao Yang).
You have had no news from [Zhou Mengdang] in these years, so you can only give up and start Taitai in "Cuizhuang", watch the spring go and autumn come, let the years pass with the falling leaves, and never ask about what your husband does. ······When you are bored, go to the "South Courtyard" to find [Yannan], teach her how to read, and pass the time. You will stay with [Yannan] to spend the night at night. Sometimes you will see [Tian] in the "South Courtyard" Chou also came to visit [Yannan].
In the first year of the Republic of China (1912), men cut off their braids and men and women were no longer strictly prohibited from meeting each other.
Last year (1913), [Tian Chou] interceded for [Yannan] in front of [Cui Shouheng], and asked [Cui Shouheng] to agree that [Yannan] go to a new school in Hefei City and live on campus to study - since then, [Yannan] has only lived in She only came back during festivals or holidays, and the maid who originally took care of her moved to the "West House" in the "North Courtyard" and continued to serve the female family members.
[Cui Shouheng] Since taking in [Tian Chou], he rarely comes to your room, and you will not go to the "main house" to look for him - now, even if you stand under the Mid-Autumn moon, you can see the cool breeze gradually rising , and there is no more sadness in your heart - you thought your heart would be like a dry well for the rest of your life, but you didn’t expect that there would be waves again...
In September of this year (1914), [Zhou Mengdang] returned to Hefei and asked "He Sao" to ask you to meet outside "Cuizhuang" and in the woods west of the bridge.
When you heard [Zhou Mengdang] say that he has not remarried for so many years, you were so excited that you almost hugged him and cried - but your husband [Cui Shouheng] is a well-known local wealthy man, so it is only natural for him to renew your relationship, no matter what Whatever you do with [Zhou Mengdang] is against etiquette... No matter how much you feel grievances, you can only ask [Zhou Mengdang] why he didn't come back earlier and had to wait for you to marry [Cui Shouheng] Appeared after?
[Zhou Mengdang] A long sigh, silent... You dare not face your former lover again, turn around with tears, run back to "Cuizhuang", stay up all night, almost swear that you will never see him again in this life【 Zhou Mengdang】·······Wait until dawn, you quickly take out a piece of valuable jewelry from the box and give it to "He Sao", making her promise not to tell anyone about you being invited to meet by [Zhou Mengdang].
A few days later, [Yannan] suddenly returned home, and then stopped going to school and stayed in "Cuizhuang".
On the Mid-Autumn Festival (October 4th), the whole family celebrates the festival together. The full moon remains the same in the sky, but the infatuation in the world is in vain.
On October 12th, you saw a somewhat familiar man chatting with [Cui Shouheng] in the "guest room" for a long time. After that, he was left by [Cui Shouheng]. After asking about it, you found out that the man was [Zhou Chitong] - -Since [Zhou Mengdang]'s family left, the house they lived in has been used as a "utility room", so [Cui Shouheng] left [Zhou Chitong] to live in the "guest room" in the "front yard".
On October 14, you heard that a young man came to "Cuizhuang" to send invitations.
On the afternoon of October 15th, [Cui Shouheng] and [Zhou Chitong] took a car to go to an appointment. [Yannan] pulled [Tian Chou] to come and chat with you. During the period, she heard from the maid that a large boat was coming from the pier. Seeing the master going up there...[Tian Chou] wanted to watch the excitement, so [Yannan] begged you as Taitai to take them out.
You nodded in agreement and went out together after dressing up with them. You walked around Cui Zhuang along the road and walked towards the lake. You saw a three-story boat parked next to the big pier. Two long wires were pulled out from the first deck. It has been connected to the tree on the west side of the big pier, with several glass products...
[Zhou Chitong] in a suit and two young men were standing under the tree. When they saw you, they greeted you.
come over.

Act 2:
The story after the pleasantries
You see [Tian Chou] and [Yannan] both accepted [Zhou Chitong]’s invitation and wanted to take the opportunity to meet [Zhou Mengdang], so they pretended to be nonchalant, nodded in agreement, and followed [Zhou Chitong] and the others on the boat. Carefully bypassing the generators, wires and tools installed in front of the boat, walked into the "banquet hall" and met [Cui Shouheng] and [Zhou Mengdang] who were having a drink inside.
[Zhou Mengdang] wore casual clothes and stood up to welcome him. [Zhou Chitong] said that they would watch "Incandescent" together after dark, and then talked about the past in "Cuizhuang"... You don't want to face it at the same time [Cui Shouheng] and [Zhou Mengdang] lowered their heads intentionally.
After all, there are differences between men and women. You then took [Tian Chou] and [Yannan] to the "small banquet hall" on the second floor for a drink, while the men stayed in the "banquet hall" - after drinking in the "small banquet hall", you were in a good mood Changed, I am even glad that I did not swear not to see [Zhou Mengdang] again, and therefore recall more memories of the past when I was passionately in love - [Zhou Mengdang] said that he was good at using crossbows, and then he took out an arrow and swore to you that he would be in the future If I fail you, I will die under my own arrow! You felt sweet after hearing this. You took the arrow and hid it, telling him not to talk nonsense, thinking that [Zhou Mengdang] would come to propose marriage soon...
When it got dark, everyone walked out of the cabin and stood on the south deck of the first floor of the boat. They were blown by the cool breeze and sobered up a little - [Su Nian] went to turn the hand-cranked "generator" and the current was quickly connected to the small electric light. Above, they emit a fleeting light - they are not dazzling, just like the rotten grass is a firefly, and it is difficult to compete with the bright moon...
[Tian Chou] was shaken by the light and her steps were unsteady, but [Yannan] helped her in time. [Tian Chou] said she felt uncomfortable due to the wind, so [Yannan] helped her back to the cabin - you want to see if [Tian Chou] drank too much, and when the wind blew her, she became drunk, so she followed them. Go in.
At this time, [Su Nian] stops the joystick, and you follow [Yannan] and [Tian Chou] upstairs. [Zhou Chitong] follows you and enters the "small banquet hall". See [Yannan] helping [Tian Chou] sit down , [Tian Chou] was lying on the table, and then you heard a drunken man’s voice shouting [Yannan] from below, like [Cui Shouheng].
You remember a few nights ago, [Cui Shouheng] came to see you and said that [Yannan] has reached the age to find her husband's family, and you must listen to him on this matter... You guessed that [Cui Shouheng] has already made up his mind He just didn't say who he was chosen for, so he pulled [Yannan] out of the "small banquet hall" and asked her if there was anyone she liked right now.
[Yannan] immediately shook his head, reminding you that he was also arranged to be forcibly married by [Cui Shouheng] and his sister before. You couldn't help but sigh, and asked [Yannan] to go down and see what happened to her father, while you stayed with [Tian Chou] , waiting for her to wake up.
You actually want to discuss [Yannan]'s marriage with [Tian Chou] and see what she thinks. Then walk back to the "small banquet hall" and meet [Zhou Chitong] coming out - you wait for [Zhou Chitong] After going out, he walked over and shook [Tian Chou] who was lying on the table awake, and asked her if she was feeling better now.
After [Tian Chou] said a few drunken words, she lay on the table again and closed her eyes - you saw [Tian Chou] answering randomly, knowing that she couldn't wake up for a while, so she had no choice but to walk out of the "small banquet hall".
You walked downstairs and thought that [Zhou Mengdang] was in the "Banquet Hall", and your heart suddenly beat very hard - you knew you shouldn't go in, but you couldn't help but push open the door of the "Banquet Hall" and saw two singers. Ji is serving [Zhou Mengdang] inside.
When [Zhou Mengdang] saw you coming in, his expression immediately changed and he explained that he just asked them to come in to change candles... After listening to [Zhou Mengdang]'s words, the two singers put on candles and walked out of the "banquet hall" , gently closed the door.
At this time, there is no one else in the "Banquet Hall". You and [Zhou Mengdang] look at each other under the swaying candlelight, as if you have gone back to a long time ago... [Zhou Mengdang] once again mentioned that he has not married in these years. , not to wait for [Bao Liu] to come back, but because he only has you in his heart!
You tell [Zhou Mengdang] to stop talking - you are [Cui Shouheng]'s Taitai now. As long as your husband is still alive, everything is impossible...
[Zhou Mengdang] had to change the topic and said that he planned to let his son marry [Yannan]... You also need to calm down, so you discussed [Yannan] and [Lianyi]'s marriage with [Zhou Mengdang]. Whether a person's horoscope is suitable or not, you should first find someone to approve it... This topic finally made you no longer nervous. Then you heard [Tian Chou] ask outside the "Banquet Hall" door: "Taitai, I want I’m back, will you come with me?”
You think that [Tian Chou] has sobered up and came downstairs to find you, and must be going back - you know again that you shouldn't be left alone, but you still use [Yannan]'s marriage as a reasonable excuse - you I haven’t finished talking about this yet, so I can’t go back!
Now that you have a reason to stay, you reply to [Tian Chou] outside the door: "I still have something to talk about. You should go back first."
"Okay, Taitai." [Tian Chou] agreed and left without entering the "banquet hall".
[Zhou Mengdang] saw that you did not follow [Tian Chou] back, so he guessed what you were thinking, so he came over and hugged you tightly... You were confused in [Zhou Mengdang]'s arms, but you couldn't forget it. Due to my identity and my recurring mood, I couldn't immediately accept this unethical passion, so I pushed [Zhou Mengdang] away and begged him to give you some time to think... [Zhou Mengdang] sat down with a wry smile. Said he would stay here waiting for you.
When you walked out of the "Banquet Hall", you looked back at [Zhou Mengdang] under the candlelight, then gently closed the door of the "Banquet Hall", turned around and went upstairs, walked into the "Small Banquet Hall" again, and drank several drinks in succession. A glass of old wine - you want to rely on wine to give yourself the courage to cross the threshold, but you are still hesitant. In addition, your drinking capacity is really not good, and drinking in a hurry only brings you a wave of dizziness - you can't even hold the wine glass, barely. Lying on the table, sobbing constantly, saying that it was all his (Zhou Mengdang's) fault... Why did he leave in the first place, and why did he come back now... Everything in front of him was blocked by tears, and everything changed. It's getting blurry...
It wasn't until you heard a knock on the door in the corridor that you opened your eyes and realized that it was already dawn and it was already October 16th...
You calmed down and heard footsteps in the corridor. Thinking that you hadn't returned home all night, you wanted to go back to "Cuizhuang" immediately.
You walked downstairs and saw [Zhou Chitong] and [Tian Chou] coming in from outside the cabin, [Yannan] coming out of "Room A", and [Lianyi] pulling [Su Nian] on the cabin corridor, pointing to the "Banquet Hall" Shouted: "My father was killed!"

Act 3:
next story
At noon, you all saw the body of [Zhou Mengdang] and stayed on the boat together, keeping everything on the boat as it was. Just when you were about to discuss and come to a conclusion, "Uncle Fu", the steward of "Cuizhuang", ran into the cabin.
"Uncle Fu" was panting and said that he came to see Taitai, his aunt and the young lady... When "Uncle Fu" saw you, he first asked you to salute, and then talked about how he saw [Lianyi] at dawn. 】I came out of "North Courtyard" to say goodbye to him. I took the lantern I borrowed from him last night and hurriedly left "Cuizhuang". It seemed that I had already said hello to the master - "Uncle Fu" remembered that the master was drunk last night. I'm back, I don't dare to disturb you right away...
After daybreak, "Uncle Fu" still didn't see the master get up and come out, so he went to knock on the door outside the "main house", but no one answered.
"Uncle Fu" said that he tried to push the door open at that time and found that the door of the "main house" was bolted from the inside. Knowing that the master had the habit of locking the door before going to bed, he knocked hard several times and called to the master, "Uncle Fu" There was still no movement inside - "Uncle Fu" was now panicked. He couldn't find Taitai, his aunt and the young lady at home. He heard that they were all invited to the "Hua Fang" yesterday, and only the young lady accompanied the master back at night. But he is not in "Cuizhuang" at this time.
"Uncle Fu" didn't dare to make his own decision, so he could only come here and go back to Taitai, his aunt and the young lady to make up his mind.
After you finish listening, take [Tian Chou] [Yannan] home, [Zhou Chitong] and [Su Nian] [Lianyi] will also accompany you, and follow "Uncle Fu" back to "Cuizhuang" and walk in "North Courtyard" and tried knocking on the door of "Master's Room" a few more times, but there was still no response.
[Yannan] got anxious and asked "Uncle Fu" to quickly find someone to break the door open - [Zhou Chitong] and [Su Nian] and [Lianyi] didn't wait for "Uncle Fu" to call the servants, and worked together to open the "house master's room" The door burst open - as the latch was broken, the door finally opened. You walked in and saw [Cui Shouheng] lying on his side on the bed, his face remained red as if he was drunk, but he was motionless, [Zhou Chitong] walked forward and tried it with his hands, and hurriedly told everyone that [Cui Shouheng] was dead and his body was cold...
[Yannan] burst into tears immediately, and [Tian Chou] held her in his arms - You were so frightened that you looked around the room and saw that the small window was opened from inside, the brazier was overturned against the wall, and the one beside the bed There is an empty bowl on the table...
